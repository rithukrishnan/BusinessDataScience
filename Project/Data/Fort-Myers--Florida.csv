The beautiful spring water lake at Pyramid Village is available for all guests to enjoy!About the Lake: Pyramid Village is a collection of pyramid homes with individual owners that share one large lake made of natural fresh spring water directly from the ground.  This lake is paved on the bottom and essentially functions like a pool as it  is tested regularly to ensure its safety. All pyramid guests are allowed to enjoy this amazing lake all year round. Unfortunately, no outside guests are allowed at the lake.  The water itself is not heated,  but it tends to warm up nicely from the sun and is generally similar to the gulf water temps.  There are plenty of chairs/ loungers to relax and enjoy this unique area.    More details about this pyramid :This unit features two total  queen bedrooms making it ideal for small groups or families.  The home features one full bathroom (with tub/shower), a fully equipped cozy kitchen, washer and dryer, and a large patio with a gas grill (propane provided).Please note- The pyramid homes are owned by various owners, each with their own descriptions, photos,amenities, prices, and rules.   We are not associated with the other owners and their websites.  We only can represent items we describe here for this pyramid.  We own a total of 8 units in pyramid village and we are not affiliated with the office or other owners on site.    All owners work together to maintain the village and to keep all guests happy throughout their stay.  To better serve you we ask that you direct your communication through us.

Spend early mornings hiking in the Four Mile Cove Ecological Preserve, around four miles away, and evenings enjoying all the shops, restaurants, and bars of the downtown Fort Myers district, just over the bridge around 10 miles away. The Yacht Club Public Beach is around five miles straight south if you want to dip your toes in the sand.

At home, enjoy easy mornings on your shady lanai, sipping coffee while the kids play in the pool. Inside, you’ll find modern, coastal decor, high ceilings, and lots of natural light. The full, well-equipped kitchen makes it easy to keep the gang fueled up for days of fun, and there’s room for everyone around the dining table for sit-down meals. Cool off at home in the central AC after days at the beach and toss the day’s clothes in the convenient washer/dryer for a quick refresh. Four streaming-capable TVs and free WiFi offer entertainment options for nights in. Keep dinner simple on the gas grill, or even simpler at one of many local restaurants in central Cape Coral, around three miles away. Call it a night in any of three comfortable bedrooms - but not before one last toast to booking a stay in Paradise.

Spend the day on the pool deck under 39 feet high foxtail palms and grill your fine filet in the integrated summer kitchen.The idea behind this villa, designed by leading local architects, is to provide plenty of space for up to 4 adult couples or 1-2 families.The spaceThe master suite with about 968 sqft living space has a large bedroom, walk-in dressing room, bath, shower, separate toilet, as well as a ""private garden"" with outdoor shower. Each of the three other bedrooms is equipped with a king-size bed, a separate dressing room and a private bathroom.The design of the villa captivates with the balance between modern architecture and a homely ambience with warm natural and earthy tones. The open living/dining area with an incredible 1,507 sqft of living space is equipped with travertine stone floors. It opens seamlessly via a fully retractable, 7 meter wide sliding door to the terrace with infinity pool, waterfall, heated spa and LED lighting.The entire furnishing is from high-quality American brands such as Lexington and Tommy Bahama. Canvas pictures with tropical motives complete the overall feeling.Each bedroom has a flat screen TV and Smartphone docks with integrated ceiling speakers. All bathrooms have double basins, private WC and a spacious (rain) shower. Furthermore, each suite has its own dressing room, in which not only your clothes but also the suitcases you brought with you can be comfortably stored. Each bedroom has king-size beds (over 78 inches wide) with high-quality American mattresses.For particularly tall people, the master bedroom has a king-size California bed for people up to 82 inches tall.The 1,507 sqft large, light-flooded entertainment area offers a lounge zone for 8 people with a spacious sofa in Coastal style and a huge 82"" flatscreen TV with Dolby Surround Sound. The entire villa has a fully integrated sound system from Sonos. Connect to your smartphone and listen to your favourite songs from up to 14 speakers in the living, dining, gaming and terrace areas.From the equally spacious dining area you have a perfect view over the pool and the channel to the southwest. The kitchen offers everything you could need to prepare your meals. There is also a Nespresso coffee maker.An 8-foot pool table rounds off the indoor entertainment.The Villa Art of Life is equipped with a digitally controlled 2-zone air conditioning system. This allows you to create your individual feel-good temperature in the master suite and the rest of the living area.Pooldeck & Spa - The well thought-out pool design offers the possibility to swim a full 42 ft long lane as well as to have a refreshing drink on the sun ledge or to relax in the heated spa area. An environmentally friendly solar pool heating system ensures pleasant water temperatures even in the cooler months without additional energy costs. In addition, it is possible to heat the pool via an energy-efficient air heat pump.A modern LED pool lighting, as well as two small waterfalls provide atmosphere in the pool area. There is an outdoor shower with hot and cold water directly on the pool deck - especially practical is the direct access to one of the bathrooms.The pool deck is very spacious due to the extra-wide property. Every guest will find a nice place to sunbathe on one of the 8 sunbeds. For those who prefer a little more shade, there is always a place under the beautiful 39 feet high foxtail palms that line the pool area. Two outside doors lead to the Captain's Walk, which delimits the whole property to the west. From here you can access the boat dock and a seating area where you can enjoy the canal or the beautiful sunsets.Another highlight of Villa Art of Life is its excellent location. Crucial for boating enthusiasts is the short distance of 8 - 10 minutes to the open water. At the same time the center of Cape Coral is only 5 minutes away by car and a Publix supermarket is only 2 minutes away.We recommend the optional rental of our own boat! A 24-foot Yamaha 242 Limited S with 360 HP is available at the boat dock with Captain's Walk. The boat is certified for up to 11 persons and has more than enough power. It is equipped with GPS, sound system and cooler. We also have other boats available.100 Mbit Highspeed Wireless - free of charge.Villa Art of Life is directly adjacent to the villa ""Perfect Life"" which is also available here at CoralVilla. Both villas are directly connected via the Captain's Walk. If you are planning a holiday with a larger group, you can accommodate up to 14 people.Attention - smoking indoors is not allowed.Out of consideration for guests with allergies pets are not allowed.

This lake is paved on the bottom and essentially functions like a pool as it  is tested regularly to ensure its safety. All pyramid guests are allowed to enjoy this amazing lake all year round. Unfortunately, no outside guests are allowed at the lake.  The water itself is not heated,  but it tends to warm up nicely from the sun and is generally similar to the gulf water temps.  There are plenty of chairs/ loungers to relax and enjoy this unique area.    More details about this pyramid :This unit features two total  queen bedrooms making it ideal for small groups or families.  The home features one full bathroom (with tub/shower), a fully equipped cozy kitchen, washer and dryer, and a large patio with a gas grill (propane provided).Please note- The pyramid homes are owned by various owners, each with their own descriptions, photos,amenities, prices, and rules.   We are not associated with the other owners and their websites.  We only can represent items we describe here for this pyramid.  We own a total of 8 units in pyramid village and we are not affiliated with the office or other owners on site.    All owners work together to maintain the village and to keep all guests happy throughout their stay.  To better serve you we ask that you direct your communication through us.  We do not describe the community as a Resort, but rather a collection of awesome vacation homes that will certainly provide you with a memorable getaway!",Lake access**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Shared pool,Entire home hosted by Jeanie,"['Scenic views\nPool view', 'Bathroom\nBathtub\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nFree washer – In unit\nFree dryer – In unit\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron\nDrying rack for clothing\nClothing storage', 'Entertainment\nHDTV with Roku\nBooks and reading material', 'Family\nCrib\nPack ’n play/Travel crib\nChildren’s books and toys', 'Heating and cooling\nCentral air conditioning\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nFreezer\nDishwasher\nStove\nOven\nCoffee maker: pour-over coffee\nWine glasses\nToaster\nBaking sheet\nBarbecue utensils\nGrill, charcoal, bamboo skewers/iron skewers, etc.\nDining table', 'Location features\nLake access\nGuests can get to a lake using a path or dock\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance\nLaundromat nearby', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nOutdoor furniture\nOutdoor dining area\nBBQ grill\nBeach essentials\nBeach towels, umbrella, beach blanket, snorkeling gear', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nShared pool', 'Services\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more\nSelf check-in\nLockbox', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-30742906/original/8b33f125-3dab-44ed-9409-07adce790529.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-30742906/original/0d876517-2678-4d57-a3af-3f5d3cb4983d.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-30742906/original/1bb212d2-d193-40ed-9878-d0e6d9363422.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-30742906/original/b4da86d0-0c11-4c55-a2f3-1faefcc0e24e.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-30742906/original/836805e2-3740-43d6-8c68-1e39430bd973.jpeg']","Hosted by Jeanie

Spend early mornings hiking in the Four Mile Cove Ecological Preserve, around four miles away, and evenings enjoying all the shops, restaurants, and bars of the downtown Fort Myers district, just over the bridge around 10 miles away. The Yacht Club Public Beach is around five miles straight south if you want to dip your toes in the sand.

At home, enjoy easy mornings on your shady lanai, sipping coffee while the kids play in the pool. Inside, you’ll find modern, coastal decor, high ceilings, and lots of natural light. The full, well-equipped kitchen makes it easy to keep the gang fueled up for days of fun, and there’s room for everyone around the dining table for sit-down meals. Cool off at home in the central AC after days at the beach and toss the day’s clothes in the convenient washer/dryer for a quick refresh. Four streaming-capable TVs and free WiFi offer entertainment options for nights in. Keep dinner simple on the gas grill, or even simpler at one of many local restaurants in central Cape Coral, around three miles away. Call it a night in any of three comfortable bedrooms - but not before one last toast to booking a stay in Paradise.

Enjoy an evening cocktail next to the large pool as the sun sets.  Then barbecue supper and enjoy the evening under the lanai with a table that easily accommodates 6.  Modern design, beautifully furnished, 2 living room areas, huge TV with superior sound system, an equipped kitchen so you won't need to worry about purchasing spices and staples.   Please check the countless wonderful reviews.The spaceYou can’t get much closer to the best of what Cape Coral has to offer than Namaste House.  The home is on a gently sloping lot with a beautiful hedge filled with red flowers that make a beautiful setting on one of the nicest boulevards with mature trees, shrubs, flowers and other spectacular Floridian vegetation.   The neighborhood has many multi-million dollar homes and many boats that are similar in value.You can access the home by road, to the driveway good for 4 cars, or by water by motor boat or sailboat.  Boat rentals are just 15 minutes away by boat to the boat slip or dock.  This home is very close to the Caloosahatchee River; it takes only about 15 minutes to get to the river by boat.   The home itself is open and spacious yet with 2 completely separate living room areas – one with a huge TV and sound system; the other with comfortable chaises ideal for afternoon tea or relaxation.  The prime feature of this home, however, is the huge lanai – at least double that of an average similar size home.  The Eddie Bauer furniture on the lanai may be the most comfortable you’ve ever experienced.  Immediately adjacent is a table for an outside supper under the lanai, adjacent to the large pool that is heated by a solar system and a heat pump.  The pool glistens and sparkles under moonlight or the beautiful sunsets that are so well viewed from the west facing lanai..  It’s so relaxing…There is room on the dock or under the mosquito cage for getting a good suntan on one of the reclining chairs that make you want to sleep.  Inside you will find the kitchen a chef’s dream, with enormous granite countertops, a very fast microwave oven, a huge refrigerator and a convection range.   The home is well equipped with spices and most basic cooking needs and a pantry with a number of staples and other food.  We welcome you to help yourself and then, when you leave,  just put your left over non-perishable food in the pantry so others can benefit just like you did.   The home is modern, built in 2003, and spacious, with high ceilings, large windows with beautiful views of the canal or the boulevard and the gorgeous vegetation.  Close by (within about 10 minutes) are the water park, the Palmetto Pines Golf Course, the Yacht Club beach and marine, countless great restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations and other amenities, however where the home is, in the very nicest part of town, there is absolutely no commercial activity.   Within about half an hour you can reach anywhere in Fort Myers, Sanibel Island, Miromar Outlet shopping and even more fantastic restaurants and interesting places to see or visit.",Waterfront**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Private pool,Entire bungalow hosted by Dale,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674775/447d88f0_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674781/37d686b1_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674788/b9c2cc09_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674795/16a7b08c_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674800/304d999e_original.jpg']","Hosted by Dale

Modern design, beautifully furnished, 2 living room areas, huge TV with superior sound system, an equipped kitchen so you won't need to worry about purchasing spices and staples.   Please check the countless wonderful reviews.The spaceYou can’t get much closer to the best of what Cape Coral has to offer than Namaste House.  The home is on a gently sloping lot with a beautiful hedge filled with red flowers that make a beautiful setting on one of the nicest boulevards with mature trees, shrubs, flowers and other spectacular Floridian vegetation.   The neighborhood has many multi-million dollar homes and many boats that are similar in value.You can access the home by road, to the driveway good for 4 cars, or by water by motor boat or sailboat.  Boat rentals are just 15 minutes away by boat to the boat slip or dock.  This home is very close to the Caloosahatchee River; it takes only about 15 minutes to get to the river by boat.   The home itself is open and spacious yet with 2 completely separate living room areas – one with a huge TV and sound system; the other with comfortable chaises ideal for afternoon tea or relaxation.  The prime feature of this home, however, is the huge lanai – at least double that of an average similar size home.  The Eddie Bauer furniture on the lanai may be the most comfortable you’ve ever experienced.  Immediately adjacent is a table for an outside supper under the lanai, adjacent to the large pool that is heated by a solar system and a heat pump.  The pool glistens and sparkles under moonlight or the beautiful sunsets that are so well viewed from the west facing lanai..  It’s so relaxing…There is room on the dock or under the mosquito cage for getting a good suntan on one of the reclining chairs that make you want to sleep.  Inside you will find the kitchen a chef’s dream, with enormous granite countertops, a very fast microwave oven, a huge refrigerator and a convection range.   The home is well equipped with spices and most basic cooking needs and a pantry with a number of staples and other food.  We welcome you to help yourself and then, when you leave,  just put your left over non-perishable food in the pantry so others can benefit just like you did.   The home is modern, built in 2003, and spacious, with high ceilings, large windows with beautiful views of the canal or the boulevard and the gorgeous vegetation.  Close by (within about 10 minutes) are the water park, the Palmetto Pines Golf Course, the Yacht Club beach and marine, countless great restaurants, grocery stores, gas stations and other amenities, however where the home is, in the very nicest part of town, there is absolutely no commercial activity.   Within about half an hour you can reach anywhere in Fort Myers, Sanibel Island, Miromar Outlet shopping and even more fantastic restaurants and interesting places to see or visit.",Waterfront**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Private pool,Entire bungalow hosted by Dale,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674775/447d88f0_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674781/37d686b1_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674788/b9c2cc09_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674795/16a7b08c_original.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/36674800/304d999e_original.jpg']","Hosted by Dale

Spend the day on the pool deck under 39 feet high foxtail palms and grill your fine filet in the integrated summer kitchen.The idea behind this villa, designed by leading local architects, is to provide plenty of space for up to 4 adult couples or 1-2 families.The spaceThe master suite with about 968 sqft living space has a large bedroom, walk-in dressing room, bath, shower, separate toilet, as well as a ""private garden"" with outdoor shower. Each of the three other bedrooms is equipped with a king-size bed, a separate dressing room and a private bathroom.The design of the villa captivates with the balance between modern architecture and a homely ambience with warm natural and earthy tones. The open living/dining area with an incredible 1,507 sqft of living space is equipped with travertine stone floors. It opens seamlessly via a fully retractable, 7 meter wide sliding door to the terrace with infinity pool, waterfall, heated spa and LED lighting.The entire furnishing is from high-quality American brands such as Lexington and Tommy Bahama. Canvas pictures with tropical motives complete the overall feeling.Each bedroom has a flat screen TV and Smartphone docks with integrated ceiling speakers. All bathrooms have double basins, private WC and a spacious (rain) shower. Furthermore, each suite has its own dressing room, in which not only your clothes but also the suitcases you brought with you can be comfortably stored. Each bedroom has king-size beds (over 78 inches wide) with high-quality American mattresses.For particularly tall people, the master bedroom has a king-size California bed for people up to 82 inches tall.The 1,507 sqft large, light-flooded entertainment area offers a lounge zone for 8 people with a spacious sofa in Coastal style and a huge 82"" flatscreen TV with Dolby Surround Sound. The entire villa has a fully integrated sound system from Sonos. Connect to your smartphone and listen to your favourite songs from up to 14 speakers in the living, dining, gaming and terrace areas.From the equally spacious dining area you have a perfect view over the pool and the channel to the southwest. The kitchen offers everything you could need to prepare your meals. There is also a Nespresso coffee maker.An 8-foot pool table rounds off the indoor entertainment.The Villa Art of Life is equipped with a digitally controlled 2-zone air conditioning system. This allows you to create your individual feel-good temperature in the master suite and the rest of the living area.Pooldeck & Spa - The well thought-out pool design offers the possibility to swim a full 42 ft long lane as well as to have a refreshing drink on the sun ledge or to relax in the heated spa area. An environmentally friendly solar pool heating system ensures pleasant water temperatures even in the cooler months without additional energy costs. In addition, it is possible to heat the pool via an energy-efficient air heat pump.A modern LED pool lighting, as well as two small waterfalls provide atmosphere in the pool area. There is an outdoor shower with hot and cold water directly on the pool deck - especially practical is the direct access to one of the bathrooms.The pool deck is very spacious due to the extra-wide property. Every guest will find a nice place to sunbathe on one of the 8 sunbeds. For those who prefer a little more shade, there is always a place under the beautiful 39 feet high foxtail palms that line the pool area. Two outside doors lead to the Captain's Walk, which delimits the whole property to the west. From here you can access the boat dock and a seating area where you can enjoy the canal or the beautiful sunsets.Another highlight of Villa Art of Life is its excellent location. Crucial for boating enthusiasts is the short distance of 8 - 10 minutes to the open water. At the same time the center of Cape Coral is only 5 minutes away by car and a Publix supermarket is only 2 minutes away.We recommend the optional rental of our own boat! A 24-foot Yamaha 242 Limited S with 360 HP is available at the boat dock with Captain's Walk. The boat is certified for up to 11 persons and has more than enough power. It is equipped with GPS, sound system and cooler.

Sliding glass doors to the lanai, provide access to the furnished balcony and the gulf, beach and pool views. Breathtaking sunsets are right in front of you as you sit peacefully on the lanai. The bedroom has a king-size bed, night stands, an armoire and a desk with another flat screen TV. Windows look out over the resort grounds. Floor to ceiling sliding doors provide privacy when needed. The en suite bathroom has a walk-in shower, vanity and storage space beneath, and a closet with plenty of storage. Being located near the southern end of the island allows exiting the area via the less traffic congested Bonita Springs rather than the northern route through Fort Myers Beach if you intend to visit some of the surrounding attractions of Southwest Florida. Santini Marina Plaza is directly across the street with its many restaurants and shops, and behind that on the bay is Fishtail Marina with a restaurant, boat charters, boat rentals and docks. Taking the Trolley north takes you to the bustling Times Square area with its myriad of shops, restaurants, and night life. To the south is the pristine Lover's Key State Park, a natural Florida environment with beautiful white sand natural beaches and tropical foliage. Estero Beach & Tennis Club 305B offers an awesome vacation destination you will surely enjoy.

Minutes away from the river and a short drive away from several beaches, you'll love creating waterfront memories on the Gulf of Mexico. Stroll through town to discover local eateries, arts, entertainment, and an array of family-friendly attractions. Rent boats or kayaks and tie them up at the dock for fishing or sightseeing. For some much-needed you-time, enjoy lounging about by the private pool and watching the boats go by while brunching on the lanai.

Upon entry, you'll be met with a bright interior and a warm feeling of welcome throughout the space. Make yourself at home by relaxing on the plush furniture, curling up with a good book, or watching your favorite shows on the large TV in the living area. Hobby chefs will love preparing grand meals and beach picnic snacks in the full kitchen, equipped with stainless steel appliances and all the cupboard room you'll ever need. Serve your loved ones home-cooked feasts at the formal dining table, creating memories that'll last a lifetime. Two Queen-size beds and a Queen-size murphy bed ensure that everyone will get a comfortable night's rest from the day's activities. Welcome to Cape Coral, your one-stop Florida getaway.

I have my 17' R-pod begging to house those willing to rough it a little.  The space is clean, useful and perfect for those on a budget.  A queen bed, use of washer and dryer along with a location that can't be beat.  Close to everything south Florida has to offer.The table converts to a single bed, there is also an option for work space if you are like me, fully remote.Very clean and cozy.  Great for those who are active and enjoy an unusual place.The spaceThis little RV was my oasis during covid. Now I want to make it yours. As an avid traveler I understand the need to have a budget location with the basic essentials. You will find that here in this cute little r-pod.It is located miles from the beach and minutes from downtown Fort Myers. You will have access to the washer and dryer for minimal fee and the use of the backyard for lounging around on your days off.This is a great place to rest your head for a week.  It is not designed to be a long term rental. If you are used to roughing it a bit, and just need a place to rest, this is perfect for your needs.Some may want an eco-friendly stay, and as an environmental engineer, I have taken steps to reduce your footprint.  This includes no plastic hand soap, dish soap and even laundry soap.  Your toilet paper is made from bamboo, not precious resources like trees.  I provide reusable no-paper paper towels as well as bamboo paper towels.  You reduce your carbon footprint by using limited power (turn everything off when you leave) and conserve water with most guest only needing 30 gallons per week (most people use 55 gallons per day).  Other than bleach (required by AirBnB), I use cleaning products not packaged in plastic.  You can bring your own bath products to reduce waste, or I can provide them (they are in plastic however).",Public or shared beach access**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi – 17 Mbps**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Free parking on premises – 1 space,Camper/RV hosted by Allison,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/439bbb71-bde7-4015-9d29-a9072d4746e0.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/8b43cee4-c428-4aff-a980-f2bc64519ee3.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/885da09c-c0d9-4993-8f08-73646ee40fbc.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/d51946a8-515f-4c6b-8384-1c03f09d4574.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/47deef8e-ca53-4a59-a8f2-1bc9b7660ec5.jpg']","Hosted by Allison
