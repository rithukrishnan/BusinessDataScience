My favorite things to do include hiking, cross country skiing, snow shoeing, kayaking, renovating my home, and most of all spending time with my family.
During your stay
Although I live next door I'm usually out hiking, kayaking, and xc skiing! We ask that guests communicate with the Air BnB app when anything is needed since we are not always at home.

In other words, if you don't like being around your friends and family, stick to hotels.

There is one full bathroom, with an open kitchen+dining+living space. The main living area has enough seating for 4-6, with an additional downstairs living room/hang out room for kids, games, and more! There is 1 king bed, 1 queen bed, and 1 full/double bed.We think the wood paneling and open design of the A-Frame transports you to a blissful escape, but keep in mind that sound may travel between the rooms, and you may hear the creak of the knotty pine beneath your feet.**Accessibility notice: the main living area is up one flight of stairs from the front door. Guests should be prepared to manage stairs regularly when staying at the lodge. **Guest Count: It's cozy, people. The lodge sleeps 4-5 adults comfortably, depending on your group dynamics. We can accommodate groups of 6 if some of the guests are children. If you have concerns about the size of your group and the lodge, shoot us a message.

What you will find: adventure, peace, quiet, woodstove, candles, down blanket, fire pit, privacy, composting outhouse, firewood for sale.  **Please note there is NO electricity and NO running water. Akin to glamping!The spaceThe Crook is just 200 square feet plus an 8'x8' sleeping loft with a steep ladder, NO ELECTRICITY, NO RUNNING WATER.  Lots of windows and a big sliding front door let in lots of light during the day.  The composting outhouse is 30' out the back door, just add some wood shavings from the bin after use.  There's a small one-burner propane stove on the counter in the small kitchen space with the basics to cook/eat for 2.  Use the blue water jug to get potable water from the blue handled hydrant by the barn (pull the handle all the way vertical - see photo).  Excellent and safe water, please do not bring bottled water!The Crook has basic insulation and the only heat source is a small Vermont Castings wood stove.  When you arrive it will likely be the same temperature as outside unless folks had a fire that morning before departing and it will take a few hours to warm up.  Firewood NOT included in price.Self-sufficiency is a must!  Be prepared for a rustic and adventurous experience.  You will find a few basics, like mugs, plates/bowls, silverware.  Bring headlamps, slippers.Heat water on the stove to wash your dishes in the wash bin - dump the water away from the Crook in the woods out back.***Firewood is available for purchase 100' from the Crook in the woodshed - its $.50 per log on the honor system, leave cash or Venmo us @Tyler-Eaton-19.

Plenty of space for 2-6 people on an adventure into the mountains available from September - early June.Firewood (only heat source) for purchase at the farm, bring sleeping bags and slippers for cold weather.  Our yurt is not a fully conditioned space, it's a somewhat insulated tent.  WINTER CAMPING EXPERIENCE - Plan accordingly, read the reviews, ask questions.The spacePlease make sure to read the entire listing for details.Its a 30' diameter yurt with 3 double hung windows and a plexiglass dome to allow natural light in.  There is electricity - kitchen lights, a few lamps and some string lights, a fridge,  and outlets in the kitchen and bedrooms.  There's a propane stovetop and counter tops inside with a propane grill outside.  Basic kitchen necessities for cooking/eating. Its a 40' path to a composting outhouse, just toss some wood shavings in after each use.  There is NO running water at the yurt - there is a 7 gallon water jug and a 2 gallon drinking jug that you can fill from the blue hydrant by the pump house across the driveway under WATER sign. (**lift all the way up and wait a few seconds for water to flow - see photos).   That space is for SUMMER USE ONLY.  Please never pour anything down the drains.There is a wood stove for heat - please READ the instruction page next to the stove, that is the only small heat source and will take a while to warm up and take the edge off.  Stove warms yurt to 40 degrees F above outside temp.  Firewood available for purchase at the farm or at the many roadside stands locally.  Depending on temperature, guests burn roughly $2-20/night.  Due to potentially invasive insects, please do not bring firewood from more than 50 miles away.THIS IS A CAMPING EXPERIENCE****The yurt has only basic insulation.  If staying with us in colder temperatures, you should be comfortable camping in the fall or winter and bring appropriate clothing, sleeping bags and gear for the temperatures.****  There is an electric blanket on the queen beed.  Please understand this is not a fully conditioned space, the wood stove can warm it up around 40-50 degrees F above the outside temp.  It is rustic, adventurous lodging - similar to renting a backcountry hut, except you can drive right up to it and its on a cool little farm with phenomenal views!
