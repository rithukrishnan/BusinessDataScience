Featuring a stunning new kitchen with gas stove overlooking the Pacific, brand new stainless appliances, indoor / outdoor seating. No need for a pool - literally step right outside take a dip in warm ocean or sunbathe on the beach in front of the cottage.  Need a beverage? Just 10 steps back into the house and roll a cooler to the beach out front. The property grounds are grassy and expansive with over 270’ft of ocean frontage, one of the largest ocean frontages in Haena / Hanalei.

Warning: You may see turtles and humpback whales swimming by and/or oversized rainbows forming over the ocean while you’re on your zoom calls which may cause co-worker envy.  Located in the idyllic town of Haena, the home is just a 5 minute walk to our local restaurant (Opakapaka Bar and Grill) and coffee shop or a quick drive to Hanalei town for ample delicious restaurant options, grocery stores and shopping.  Tunnels beach is a quick bike ride or drive with some of Kauai’s best snorkeling and highest chance of swimming with our local resident Sea Turtles ‘Honus’. Haena is also home to a few celebrities (Pierce Brosnan (007), Anthony Kiedis, etc.) drawn in by the serenity and beauty of this north shore surf town. Another mile down the road you will enter Haena State Park and Ke’e Beach and the start of the Na Pali trail, Kauai’s most epic hiking trail.   If you are looking to escape the main touristy spots in Kauai (Poipu, Kapa’a & Princeville) you will likely love staying in Haena.

Outside is a private shower with a spectacular view of the jungle, private deck, barbecue, tiki torches to enjoy the evening, and all the style of old Hawaii. Located just 100 steps to one of Kauai's most secluded North Shore beaches! If you are seeking a Honeymoon hideaway or romantic getaway, look no further :)The spaceIpo Cottage is the manifestation of our dream of living nestled in between the lush, verdant Kauai jungle and the beautiful turquoise ocean.  Experience the incredible beauty of the north shore from our beach cottage just 100 steps to the tropical Pacific Ocean.  Directly behind the cottage is a lush jungle hillside that borders thousands of acres of private nature conservancy land tucked into a secluded, kamani tree lined cul-de-sac.  The sun rises directly in front of the cottage over the ocean and you can walk down the private drive to put your toes in the sand or snorkel right in front of the house on a calm summer day at Kepuhi point with one of the most beautiful coves on the North shore just in front of the cottage to the right (east).  The North Shore of Kauai feels like “heaven on earth”  attracting a consciousness and reverence for the awe-inspiring nature, combining raw stunning beauty in a mesmerizing array of impossible mountain scapes, endless beaches, lush tropical jungles, adventure opportunities, beach charm and a laid back surfer-vibe beach charm. Haena beaches offer some of Hawaii's best surfing, shelling, sunning, and snorkeling. The home is a just under 3 miles (5 min drive) to Ke’e Beach and the entrance of the legendary Kalalau trail which runs along the picturesque Na Pali Coast. A quick 10 minute drive to Hanalei town will bring you to a variety of restaurants and charming boutiques. Here you will also find Hanalei Bay, a two-mile white sand crescent beach, which is ideal for surfing, stand up paddle boarding, kayaking, fishing, and good old fashioned swimming. Princeville is just up the road and provides activities such as golf, zip-lining, and horseback riding.  Or just take the beach chairs and walk the steps to the beach out front.  Beach gear is provided including beach chairs, cooler, umbrella, boogie boards. As the owners are in health and wellness there is a  concerted effort to add healing touches such as a Biomat and diffusers for essential oils to the home to make it nourishing as well as comfortable.  We use all natural products and reduce our impact on the environment as we strive to offer an eco-friendly home, featuring efficient appliances, lighting, recycling.  Our tap water is supplied from the local purified rainwater so there is no need to bring bottled water.  Please be sure to use Reef-safe sunblock during your stay in Kauai as well. We hope you love Kauai as much as we do and will make an effort to join us in these simple measures to protect this beautiful land. Located in the idyllic town of Haena, the home is just a 5 minute walk to our local restaurant (Opakapaka Bar and Grill) and coffee shop or a quick drive to Hanalei town for ample delicious restaurant options, grocery stores and shopping.  Tunnels beach is a quick bike ride or drive with some of Kauai’s best snorkeling and highest chance of swimming with our local resident Sea Turtles ‘Honus’. Please note - you are visiting the tropics and anywhere you stay in Hawaii you will likely see more insects than you do on the mainland. They are part of the eco-system and thankfully none are harmful.

It is located right next to the parking lot.  Most units at Hanalei Bay Resort require a use of a personal shuttle bus to reach their destination.SPECIAL Note:  (1) Does Kauai Have A Night Scene? Not really ... If you are looking for nightlife, you should probably stay in Honolulu.(2) Not suitable for guests that need extreme quietness.  When lanai doors are open, noise may be heard from guest shuttle service, resort vendor ect…(Closing lanai doors will remedy this concern).(3) Correction: NO snorkeling gear/beach blanket provided but instead 2 boogie boards, igloo, beach umbrella, 2 beach chairs and 2 rain umbrellas are provided under beach amenities.(4) Bathroom is design as a wet shower area which allows for the floors to get wet outside the shower area.

You will be mesmerized by the impossibly turquoise waters, dramatic cloud formations and never ending horizons!The spaceWe welcome you with sincere Aloha to our home on Kauai, Hale Kamapua'a ( kah-mah-poo-AH-ah). Named for the Hawaiian pig-god known for his awesome power and magical ability to appear in different forms, he was transformed by love and is known as the protector of the verdant forests of Hawaii. The North Shore of Kauai is one of the most special and beautiful places on Earth. Our goal is to offer a home that is as Green and Eco friendly as possible. To that end we respectfully ask that you not bring single use plastic water bottles into our home. We provide ample stainless steel, reusable water bottles for your use while staying at Hale Kamapua'a. Luckily, Kauai is blessed with excellent drinking water directly from the tap. Reef-safe sunblock is the law in Hawaii. Please don't bring sunblock purchased on the mainland unless you are certain it is rated as ""reef-safe"". We provide a large can of quality reef-safe sunblock to get you started. All appliances, the air conditioning system, and water heater are recently purchased and chosen for their energy efficiency. In an effort to reduce the packaging waste in our home, we provide bulk purchased compostable trash bags, ample supplies of detergent, laundry soap, paper towels and toilet tissue.  Each of the three bathrooms is also supplied with large bottles of shampoo and large bars of soap. We ask you to join us in our efforts by separating recyclables, cleaning them and placing them in the blue bins provided. We have contracted to have the recycling picked up weekly. We hope you love Kauai as much as we do and will make the effort to join us in these simple measures to protect her.The house includes a master bedroom upstairs with king sized bed, bathroom, large flat screened TV, walk-in closet and ample comfortable seating. There is also a private lanai with a corner view of the ocean and full view of the jungle cascading down the cliff face in the back with seating that includes an outdoor easy chair, the perfect place to sit back and watch the formations of tropical birds flying overhead or to enjoy a passing tropical rain shower.There is also a loft upstairs with a magnificent ocean view, a sitting area and a daybed(punei). It's the perfect place to enjoy a good book or an afternoon nap. There are two bedrooms downstairs, both with queen sized beds, bathrooms, closets and flat screened TVs. One bedroomis nestled in the back of the house and offers a private, quiet solitude and is the favorite room of one of the owners: AKA ""The Man-Cave"". The other bedroom is on the side of the house with views of the ocean and sliding glass door that opens on to the wrap around lanai.All three bedrooms feature recently purchased quality mattresses. The bedding and linens and towels are all better quality, including an ample supply of extra large beach towels.The owners are retired from the San Francisco restaurant scene, a fact which is reflected in the generously appointed kitchen. Ample quality dinnerware, utensils and cookware are provided. All appliances are new or recently purchased. There is a new gas BBQ grill on the lanai.After a day at the beach, there are two convenient foot washing stations with hoses at the base of each of the two staircases leading up to the lanai to help keep sand off your feet and out of the house. There is also a luxurious, warm water, private outdoor shower.The house is fully air conditioned with separate wall units serving each bedroom and the downstairs living room. Each room has its own remote control and individual rooms may be closed off and air conditioned or left open to the breezes and sound of the ocean with the AC turned off.",Beach access – Beachfront**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**TV with standard cable,Entire home hosted by Paul,"['Bathroom\nBathtub\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nWasher\nDryer\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron', 'Entertainment\nTV with standard cable', 'Heating and cooling\nAir conditioning', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nCoffee maker', 'Location features\nBeach access – Beachfront\nGuests can enjoy a nearby beach\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nLockbox\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/83ed1fd7-f670-4c1a-ab5a-1e05b27e9bbe.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/9f3e63f5-ba68-453c-918d-0df39248e779.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/5db6e2dc-a2d8-47de-8c76-89b5133062a9.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2f5bf91d-397f-4be1-987f-a8e8d8d29a07.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/e1fd1d5b-4b53-43c3-8c24-ade11f37d877.jpg']","Hosted by Paul

Includes full kitchen, washer/dryer, cable tv with DVD player, free wifi. Two full bathrooms, both with tub and shower, one upstairs and one downstairs.  Since this is an upstairs condo, there is nobody above you!Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge Kauai are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike brings you to the secluded Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove.  The ocean at Sealodge Beach is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming.The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, island casual, and ocean-breeze cooled (no AC).Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car. Rental cars may be in limited supply, please book your transportation needs early.Although this home has internet, the speed and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the remote location and the service being provided by a third-party.

Your vacation home is set up with years of experience in guest hosting. As mentioned in all of my reviews, the space is extremely clean, and fully equipped so you’ll enjoy returning home after a day of adventure. Cook home made meals in a full kitchen stocked with everything you'd expect at your own home. Use your own washer/dryer, sleep in a new memory foam king bed with 6 pillows, high thread count sheets and cotton Tommy Bahama bedding. Sip your morning coffee on a private lanai with a glimpse of the Mamalahoa Mountain Range peaks and surrounding jungle before taking a stroll on the 2 mile path just outside your front door. The sunset view from an ocean front cliff is spectacular, and just a couple of minutes walk down the path.Hale Moi is a condominium complex of both residents and vacationers. *Quiet hours at Hale Moi are observed from 9pm to 8am.Your unit is in the 1st building of the complex on ground level, with a common wall on one side and golf course acreage on the other which provides a unique private setting. However, you may still hear sounds of nearby neighbors or from the road, or even from wild chickens during the day. They are most active in the morning so if you are a late sleeper, I recommend ear plugs. This is the case anywhere you stay on Kauai.*Your unit has designated parking very close to front door! *BBQ (complex shared picnic area) is conveniently located in the middle of property grounds. No BBQ equipment permitted at your unit. No open fires permitted anywhere on property. *Complimentary guest starter supplies provided in unit: Coffee and filter, paper towels, new dish sponge, dish soap and dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, garbage bags, shampoo/conditioner, body soap, hand soap, and 2 toilet paper rolls. In addition: 2 bath towel sets (body/hand/face) per guest and 2 beach towels, (1 per guest). For your convenience,  we also provide a cooler, a beach umbrella and beach chairs. We do not provide snorkel gear due to Covid. Please note that we do not have AC. It really helps that this is a downstairs unit, so the space is a lot cooler than the other units on property. There are ceiling fans in every room, plus area fans to help cool you down. With the windows open, the Tradewinds are enough to circulate air inside your condo. *Note: We also have another unit right next door if you have more than 2 in your party and want to stay close-by each other.

However, you may still hear sounds of nearby neighbors or from the road, or even from wild chickens during the day. They are most active in the morning so if you are a late sleeper, I recommend ear plugs. This is the case anywhere you stay on Kauai.*Your unit has designated parking very close to front door! *BBQ (complex shared picnic area) is conveniently located in the middle of property grounds. No BBQ equipment permitted at your unit. No open fires permitted anywhere on property. *Complimentary guest starter supplies provided in unit: Coffee and filter, paper towels, new dish sponge, dish soap and dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, garbage bags, shampoo/conditioner, body soap, hand soap, and 2 toilet paper rolls. In addition: 2 bath towel sets (body/hand/face) per guest and 2 beach towels, (1 per guest). For your convenience,  we also provide a cooler, a beach umbrella and beach chairs. We do not provide snorkel gear due to Covid. Please note that we do not have AC. It really helps that this is a downstairs unit, so the space is a lot cooler than the other units on property. There are ceiling fans in every room, plus area fans to help cool you down.

The studio has a kitchenette (small fridge & freezer, single burner with frying pan and saucepan, toaster, coffee maker). I also supply the unit with utensils to use at the BBQ at the pool area. Has large TV with DVD player. I also provide shampoo, conditioner, and body wash for the shower. Comes also with linens, towels, and hair dryer. THERE IS NO A/C in the unit and it can warm up during the summer months, but usually cools down in the night.There are no laundry facilities in the complex. Closest laundromat - Laundromat Express - is located in Kapaa which is 35 min away.I follow Airbnb’s enhanced cleaning protocol, which was developed with expert guidance. Here are a few highlights:I sanitize high-touch surfaces, down to the doorknobI use cleaners and disinfectants approved by global health agencies, and I wear protective gear to help prevent cross-contaminationI clean each room using extensive cleaning checklistsI provide extra cleaning supplies, so you can clean as you stayI comply with local laws, including any additional safety or cleaning guidelines",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Shared pool**__**Shared hot tub,Entire rental unit hosted by Juliana,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nIron\nDrying rack for clothing', 'Entertainment\nTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix', 'Heating and cooling\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nMini fridge\nFreezer\nStove\nCoffee maker: Keurig coffee machine\nToaster\nDining table', 'Location features\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nShared backyard – Not fully fenced\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nOutdoor furniture\nBBQ grill\nBeach essentials\nBeach towels, umbrella, beach blanket, snorkeling gear', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nShared pool\nShared hot tub', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/3a0acd45-d05a-41a7-952e-67c0f188297f.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/d28af5bc-26d2-44a4-b86f-5b9d8e9afd30.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2881fe01-3b44-4c69-92e6-9a2358329010.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/1a01326d-88dc-48a4-a15c-af83a4a0a728.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/8a7909d6-48d0-4a16-b12f-a0374b288e7f.jpg']","Hosted by Juliana

These Hanalei vacation rentals are directly on the beach...no path to follow, just take a few steps and you're on the sand.  And I1 is the closest building, directly on the beach.  You can also take advantage of the restaurant and spa onsite, or prepare your own food in your apartment's full kitchen or on the gas grills provided.  Pool, jacuzzi and barbecue are conveniently close.This condo has a large shady lanai that puts you 10 steps from the sand.  There are two bedrooms, one with a king bed and the other with two twin beds.  For privacy, the bedrooms can be closed off from the rest of the unit with sliding shoji screens, which still allow air flow to keep you cool at night.  The living and dining areas are comfortably furnished and there are spectacular beach views from the large picture windows.  There's a full bath and a half bath.  While there are no televisions or cable television service in the complex, wifi is provided so you won't be completely cut off from the modern world.  (Only as cut off as you want to be.)In addition to Hanalei Colony Resort I1's beautiful interior and views, and the beach just in front,  guests can enjoy the swimming pool, jacuzzi, barbecue grills, and guest laundry room.  You can walk next door to the Opakapaka Bar and Grill. Also located just across the parking lot is the Hanalei Day Spa. Just ten minutes past the charming town of Hanalei, you'll find that shopping and dining options are conveniently close.  It's the perfect Kauai vacation rental for proposals, honeymoons, anniversaries, and other romantic occasions.As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Casual tropical interior includes perfect work-from-home space gazing directly out at the beach!The spaceOur Haena vacation rentals at the Hanalei Colony Resort are mere steps from the beach.  These highly desirable north shore Kauai rentals offer spectacular and unspoiled ocean scenery with incredible whitewater views from your private lanai.  Hanalei Colony Resort J3 takes full advantage of the trade winds, and the large shady lanai also helps keep it cool inside.  If the trade winds die down, multiple high-speed fans provide plenty of breeze as well.  And because this unit has a convenient desk area (facing one of the picture windows with its spectacular oceanfront views), it is also perfect for those who need to mix a little work with their wave-watching!  If you want to get out and enjoy a walk along the beach, you can walk all the way along the beach for literally hours before reaching the “end of the road” at Kee Beach – a walk that will take you past world-famous Tunnels Beach as well. Hanalei Colony Resort is perfect for a romantic couple's getaway...but there's also plenty of room for you to bring the kids.  The master bedroom is furnished with a king bed, and can be closed off from the living area with sliding shoji-style doors.  The shoji doors' slatted construction provide visual privacy while still allowing air flow so you'll sleep cool at night.  The second bedroom has a full size sleeper sofa and a twin day bed.  If you're not using it as sleeping space, it makes a perfect office, or comfy additional hang-out space.  The second bedroom also can be closed off from the living area with sliding louver doors.  You'll find a comfortably furnished living room, with another sleeper sofa, and a dining area that can seat 5 people.  The full kitchen is equipped with everything you need to prepare simple meals at home...which you can enjoy on the lanai while listening to the sound of the waves!  Enjoy the resort amenities including swimming pool, jacuzzi, barbecue grills, and guest laundry room.  Please note that as a guest in a privately managed unit, you won't be able to ride the resort shuttle.As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Relax on the punee (that’s a window seat in the living room  - twin bed size, so a great place for a child to sleep) and enjoy the cooling breeze as you listen to the sounds of the surf and admire the sight of a sunrise over the ocean.  The bedroom is furnished with a queen bed.  There is an accordion door that slides shut to provide privacy in the bedroom.  Smart television and free wifi are included.  Full kitchen.  Coin operated washer and dryer in the next building.      Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike brings you to the secluded Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove.  The ocean at Sealodge Beach is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming. The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, and island casual, a more private and secluded alternative to Kauai hotels. Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Compact but well-designed & charming. Comfy pillowtop queen mattress, luxurious bamboo sheets, 32"" HDTV, small fridge, Keurig coffee maker, tea kettle, microwave, ample beach gear, dresser, a safe, and fast internet. Perfectly located in a quiet complex minutes to the shops at Princeville Ctr, quaint Hanalei town, Queen's Bath, many lovely beaches and hiking.The spaceIki helu'ai means ""little gem"" in Hawaiian and I think the guest's area is exactly that. The bedroom itself is a pretty compact space--12.5 feet x 11 feet or 140 square feet--but I think my guests find it charming, well designed and comfortable. Our condo complex is in an excellent location in the lovely and safe community of Princeville.. It is well away from the main road (Ka Haku) so it's very peaceful and quiet and full of beautiful mature trees and plants. You mostly only hear birds singing (unless it's grounds maintenance day but even then it's only a few minutes of noise!). And the newly retiled complex pool and complimentary parking are just steps away. My unit is located on the 12th hole of the gorgeous Makai golf course as well and guests can enjoy strolling out on the paths in the mornings before golf is played or evenings when it's done to enjoy the incredible ocean views and  bird life, even a nesting albatross for part of the year (Nov-June)..Humpback whales can also be observed between Dec-April...The guest's space can be entered/exited via the lanai without disturbing us in the main part of the residence. The guest's hallway, bedroom and bath are on the ground level within our home but both drapes and sliding wood, barn-style door clearly defines and separates the space from the rest of the home and provides ample privacy. Additionally, the bedroom itself has its own internal locking door as well, so I believe my goal of providing guests with comfort and privacy has been achieved. The bedroom and patio are east facing--it's a lovely spot to have your morning coffee-- is shaded by a pretty tree and does not bake in the afternoon sun--or evening cocktail ! I look forward to welcoming my guests to magnificent Kauai and always do my utmost to ensure a wonderful stay!Note: The nightly rate includes taxes so it's a great value!",Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Pool**__**TV**__**Private patio or balcony**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Private room in condo hosted by Andie,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/4962c046-d92b-428c-97c0-3c47337bb140.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/58c1bc9c-4b69-4a85-8ffe-740e47c78e57.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/ee642f73-c6a3-4483-bf0e-7eb406b9260a.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/d818d25b-e82a-4237-867f-872a3a521976.jpeg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-21764477/original/7c6c00d9-c5ec-4679-8f8d-a7768ca43719.jpeg']","Hosted by Andie

Includes cable TV and wifi.The spaceSealodge E8: This affordable one bedroom Sealodge Kauai condo offers an amazing oceanfront view.  Relax on the punee (that’s a window seat in the living room  - twin bed size, so a great place for a child to sleep) and enjoy the cooling breeze as you listen to the sounds of the surf and admire the sight of a sunrise over the ocean.  The bedroom is furnished with a queen bed.  There is an accordion door that slides shut to provide privacy in the bedroom.  Smart television and free wifi are included.  Full kitchen.  Coin operated washer and dryer in the next building.      Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike brings you to the secluded Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove.  The ocean at Sealodge Beach is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming. The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, and island casual, a more private and secluded alternative to Kauai hotels. Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car. Rental cars may be in limited supply, please book your transportation needs early.Although this home has internet, the speed and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the remote location and the service being provided by a third-party.Hawaii Vacation Rental Registration Number TA-013-019-1360-01",Ocean view**__**Sea view**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire condo hosted by Kauai Kahuna,"['Scenic views\nOcean view\nSea view', 'Bathroom\nHair dryer\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nWasher\nDryer\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nCoffee maker', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nPool', 'Services\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more\nSelf check-in\nLockbox', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nThere is no carbon monoxide detector on the property.\nUnavailable: Shampoo\nShampoo\nUnavailable: Private entrance\nPrivate entrance\nUnavailable: Heating\nHeating']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/0dfb4916-8449-4a80-9d11-b4344cfc0013.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/c6070190-9a39-4621-9327-55cb67b5c630.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/d5a47f65-28d8-475d-9f5c-b408f077b293.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/ff1cab81-453f-4269-ab3c-0a79aecbfc5d.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/e2f7b61b-7b74-40bc-818b-4c1144a7e1de.jpg']","Hosted by Kauai Kahuna

It's perfect for a honeymoon, proposal, or other romantic occasion.  The bedroom is furnished with a queen size bed, and the ocean view from the bedroom window is delightful, you don't even have to get out of bed to enjoy it.  There's a punae in the living room (basically a Hawaiian daybed built into the window alcove) which is a perfect spot to relax and read while enjoying the view and the cool ocean breeze.  Bedding is provided, so if you're traveling with a child, they'll have their own sleeping space.  The sofa also opens into a queen size bed, so three companions traveling together can each have their own bed.  The full kitchen even includes a dishwasher, and has everything you need for preparing and enjoying simple meals at home.

The bathroom has separate vanity and toilet/shower areas so two people can get ready in the morning at the same time.

The private lanai with seating for two is perfect for morning coffee, an informal al fresco dinner, or a quiet hour with a good book as you're cooled by the ocean breezes.  The comfortably furnished living room has an oceanfront reading nook, and tasteful Hawaiian decor.   New in March 2021 are a freshly updated kitchen and new flooring throughout.

Beautifully updated inside with oceanfront views and literally 12 steps to the sand at unique, secluded Hanalei Colony Resort.  Private, romantic, yet just 15 minutes from shopping and dining in Hanalei.The spaceHanalei Colony Resort I2 is unique among north shore Kauai condo resorts.  These Hanalei vacation rentals are directly on the beach...no path to follow, just take a few steps and you're on the sand.  And I2 is literally just a few steps to the beach, with absolutely amazing sea views from every room.  The only way you could be any closer to the water is if you were actually on a boat!  You can also take advantage of the restaurant and spa onsite, or prepare your own food in your apartment's full kitchen or on the gas grills provided.  Pool, jacuzzi, guest laundry room, and barbecue are conveniently close.Hanalei Colony Resort I2 is completely updated inside with a prime oceanfront location at north shore Kauai's only true beachfront resort.  You can see the beach from your living room and bedroom windows, and once you step out onto the shady lanai, it's only a couple more steps and you're right there on the secluded sandy beach that fronts the property!Inside, you'll find a full kitchen, beautifully updated with subway tile backsplash and custom cabinetry.  There are two full bathrooms, also recently updated.  The first bedroom is furnished with a king bed, and the guest bedroom has a queen size bed.  Both bedrooms can be closed off from the shared living areas with wooden louver doors that preserve the refreshing airflow while providing visual privacy.  Note that sound will still carry, so if you're streaming a late-night movie, be sure to keep the volume low.  The living room and dining area each comfortably accommodate 4 people.  Your private (furnished) lanai is absolutely perfect for enjoying a morning cup of coffee or evening glass of wine while relaxing to the sounds of the surf and enjoying the cool breeze.  While there are no televisions in the apartments, wifi is provided so you won't be completely cut off from the modern world.  (Only as cut off as you wish to be.)In addition to Hanalei Colony Resort I2's beautiful interior and perfect sea views of the beach just in front,  guests can enjoy the swimming pool, jacuzzi, barbecue grills, and guest laundry room.  You can walk next door to the Opakapaka Bar and Grill. Also located just across the parking lot is the Hanalei Day Spa. Just ten minutes past the charming town of Hanalei, you'll find that shopping and dining options are conveniently close.  It's the perfect Kauai vacation rental for proposals, honeymoons, anniversaries, and other romantic occasions.As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car. Rental cars may be in limited supply, please book your transportation needs early.Although this home has internet, the speed and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the remote location and the service being provided by a third-party.Hawaiian Vacation Rental ID: TA-111-089-5104-02",Bay view**__**Ocean view**__**Public or shared beach access – Beachfront**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire condo hosted by Kauai Kahuna,"['Scenic views\nBay view\nBeach view\nOcean view\nSea view', 'Bathroom\nHair dryer', 'Bedroom and laundry\nPaid washer\nPaid dryer\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron\nClothing storage: closet', 'Entertainment\n43"" TV', 'Heating and cooling\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nStove\nOven\nCoffee maker\nWine glasses\nToaster\nBlender\nRice maker\nDining table', 'Location features\nPublic or shared beach access – Beachfront\nGuests can enjoy a nearby beach\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance\nFree resort access\nGuests can use nearby resort facilities', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nBackyard\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nOutdoor furniture\nShared outdoor kitchen\nBBQ grill: gas\nBeach essentials\nBeach towels, umbrella, beach blanket, snorkeling gear', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nShared pool\nShared hot tub - available all year', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nKeypad\nCheck yourself into the home with a door code\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nThis place may not have a carbon monoxide detector.

You can't go wrong with this charming Sealodge condo.The spaceYou'll love the ocean views, charmingly updated interior, and accessible ground floor location of Sealodge F1.  The sliding glass doors and picture windows face the water, which means in addition to a nice ocean view, you'll catch the tradewinds and stay cool.  During those occasional times when the tradewinds die down, ceiling fans and floor fans will keep you comfortable.  A Hawaiian punee (twin bed built into a living room alcove like a daybed ) provides cool breezes and ocean views, a perfect spot for reading or napping.  The bedroom is furnished with a queen size bed  and you'll be able to enjoy watching the waves without even having to get out of bed, because the bedroom window also has a view!  The modern (remodeled) kitchen provides enough space and amenities that you'll enjoy preparing simple meals at home and dining al fresco on your private ocean view lanai.  Inside, there's seating for 4 in the dining area.  And the lovely updated bathroom has a walk in shower and plenty of counter space to share.  The guest laundry room is in the same building, and the swimming pool is nearby - just on the other side of the building - without being too close.Our Kauai vacation rentals at Sealodge are located at the end of a small quiet side road, with no through traffic, that ends at a dramatic ocean bluff.  These Princeville condos face the ocean on their lanai side.  A short hike from these budget friendly Kauai condos brings you to the secluded north shore Sealodge Beach. The jungle trail crosses a small stream then descends to a secluded sandy cove, where the ocean is shallow and protected by a reef, making it ideal for snorkeling and swimming.The Sealodge condos were built so you can see the rolling white water waves from the living room windows, the bedroom windows, and the lanai.  From all three of these locations you can hear the surf, watch for whales, spinner dolphins, and exotic birds. There is a pool and BBQ area (grills are charcoal and you must bring your own briquettes). Sealodge is comfortable, quiet, and island casual.Update 11/9/22 (*Please note that the Sealodge swimming pool is undergoing repairs and is expected to be out of service until March 2023*) As with most homes on Kauai, this vacation rental is NOT air conditioned.It is very difficult to get around Kauai without a rental car.

Newly remodeled and furnished, this condo offers breathtaking views of the mountains and private access to the exclusive Hideaways Beach. In addition, it features a new community pool and jacuzzi, smart key technology for a seamless check-in, blazing-fast wifi, and a spacious layout with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.The spaceExperiencing life in Pali Ke Kua is like nothing else on earth. This resort community is situated on the north shore of the picturesque island of Kauai, allowing you to enjoy the sweeping views of the Bali Hai Mountains while relaxing on your own outdoor lounge furniture surrounded by flowering tropical plants and trees. Be sure to keep an eye towards the mountains after a soaking rain. Kauai boasts some of the most magnificent waterfalls you can imagine!Living SpaceUpon your arrival, you’ll feel a sense of ease as you’re welcomed into the large living room with cathedral ceilings, plush couches, and large windows that allow you direct views of the surrounding scenery regardless of where you settle in. Kitchen & Dining AreaFeeling a little hungry? Look no further than the spacious kitchen that’s fit for a chef. This space has been perfectly laid out and equipped to make preparing and cooking meals a breeze with its large stainless steel fridge, oven, microwave, and toaster oven. There’s also plenty of counter space for laying out snacks, chopping up fresh fruit you picked up at the nearby market, or for mixing your favorite cocktails. But the biggest feature of the kitchen is that even while doing dishes, you’ll still be able to take in the views, so you never have to miss a sunset. The condo also has a dedicated dining room with seating for four, where you can enjoy a delicious breakfast or coffee while listening to the birds sing just outside the large picture windows. Bedrooms & BathroomsNo vacation or getaway is complete without having a restful sleep. For that reason, special attention has been paid to ensuring that each of the two primary bedrooms is furnished with supportive and comfortable beds, wrapped in quality linens, and decorated in light and airy neutral tones allowing for the view of the tropical trees through the windows to be the star of the show. Primary Suite - Main FloorThe first primary suite is found on the main floor and features a king-sized bed along with a spacious private en-suite that features a double vanity, walk-in shower, and a full-size stackable washer and dryer so your towels will always be dry, and you won't have to dread being overwhelmed with laundry when you return home. Second Guest Suite - Upstairs LoftThe second guest suite is located in the upstairs loft featuring a queen-sized bed. It also boasts its own private 4-piece ensuite with a single vanity, ample counter space, and a walk-in shower that makes getting ready each day a luxurious experience.Outdoor AmenitiesStaying at Pali Ke Kua is a decision to spend time in a true outdoor paradise. Guests swoon over the grounds and amenities where their biggest struggle each day is deciding whether to enjoy the beach the pool or head into town to explore. At Pali Ke Kua, we have a private, paved trail allowing you to walk directly to the Hideaways Beach if you're looking to experience the best of Hawaii on an uncrowded sandy beach. This area is known for its outstanding snorkeling in the calm summer months and surfing in the winter months; there’s also a chance to encounter turtles and spot schools of dolphins as they pass by.  If all that sun and fun have you feeling hungry, you’ll find the pizza restaurant on the property a fantastic option for satisfying your cravings. Don’t wait another minute! This tropical oasis is waiting to welcome you and give you the time and space to relax, unwind and fall in love with the aloha state of mind.",Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**Pool**__**TV**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm,Entire condo hosted by Princeville Vacation Rentals,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nHot water', 'Bedroom and laundry\nWasher\nDryer\nHangers\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron', 'Entertainment\nTV', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nDishwasher\nStove\nOven\nCoffee maker', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nPool', 'Services\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Air conditioning\nAir conditioning\nUnavailable: Essentials\nEssentials\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nThis place may not have a carbon monoxide detector.

If you’re looking to escape the crowds and enjoy your own piece of paradise overlooking one of Kauai’s most secluded North Shore beaches with turquoise blue water, you found it! We invite you to enjoy the perfect space to experience Kauai’s majestic North Shore.The spaceHale Aloha is the manifestation of the dream of living nestled in between the lush, verdant Kauai jungle and the beautiful turquoise ocean. Experience the incredible beauty of the north shore from our 4 bedroom, 2 bath, 2100 sq. ft. beach house. The upstairs living area wrap-around glass 270-degree view overlooks the tropical landscaping and the secluded beach just steps away. Directly behind the house is a lush jungle hillside that borders thousands of acres of private nature conservancy land tucked into a private, kamani tree-lined cul-de-sac.  Enjoy white water ocean views and the sound of the ocean waves from your spacious lanai or even as you cook from your granite countertop chef’s kitchen. The sun rises directly in front of the house over the ocean and you can walk down the private drive to put your toes in the sand or snorkel right in front of the house on a calm summer day at Kepuhi point with one of the most beautiful coves on the North shore just in front of the house to the right. This is the making of the Kauai experience that your soul has been longing for.A freshly painted large lanai with a grill hooked up to gas is perfect for outdoor dining and lounging to the stars and sounds of the ocean. The upstairs is an open concept design with glass on 3 sides which seamlessly flows from chef’s kitchen to dining room to living room to lanai to the ocean. Since the living space is upstairs there is a feeling of being up in the trees. There is excellent high speed internet, flatscreen with Netflix streaming, dining room, living room and lanai.Each room has lovely, stylish island decor. Upstairs is an airy king Bedroom with views of your private backyard and an ancient, sacred Rudraksha tree. Downstairs are 2 queen bedrooms and the master suite, with 4 poster hand carved teak King bed, walk-in closet, large bathtub, inside and outside showers and private lanai. There is a separate laundry area and carport. Beach gear is provided including beach chairs, cooler, umbrella, boogie boards, 2 soft top surfboards, a mid length surfboard and snorkel equipment. The North Shore of Kauai feels like “heaven on earth” attracting a consciousness and reverence for its awe-inspiring nature, combining raw stunning beauty in a mesmerizing array of impossible mountain scapes, endless beaches, lush tropical jungles and adventure opportunities with laid back surfer-vibe beach town charm. Haena beaches offer some of Hawaii's best surfing, shelling, sunning, and snorkeling. The home is just under 3 miles (5 min drive) to Ke’e Beach and the entrance of the legendary Kalalau trail which runs along the picturesque Na Pali Coast. A quick 10 minute drive to Hanalei town will bring you to a variety of restaurants and charming boutiques. Here you will also find Hanalei Bay, a two-mile white sand crescent beach, which is ideal for surfing, stand up paddle boarding, kayaking, fishing, and good old fashioned swimming. Princeville is just up the road and provides activities such as golf, zip-lining, and horseback riding. Or just take the beach chairs and walk down the drive to the beach out front.As the owners are in health and wellness, there is a concerted effort to add healing touches such as a Biomat Professional Model (heated far-infrared and negative ion mat which helps with jet-lag, increases immunity and soothes aches and pains) and a Bioaccoustic Mat (vibrational sound healing brain entrainment mat with sleep, relaxation, etc. settings) for guests to enjoy while relaxing in the living room; perfect for sore muscles after a long day of activity or for spa day treatment in your own home.A diffuser and set of Young Living essential oils make the home nourishing as well as comfortable. Yoga mats are provided as the spacious lanai deck is the perfect place to practice yoga with an ocean view.  A certified yoga teacher is available to teach at the house upon request (for an additional fee)Located in the idyllic town of Haena, the home is just a 5 minute walk to our local restaurant (Opakapaka Bar and Grill) and coffee shop or a quick drive to Hanalei town for ample delicious restaurant options, grocery stores and shopping.  Tunnels beach is a quick bike ride or drive with some of Kauai’s best snorkeling and highest chance of swimming with our local resident Sea Turtles ‘Honus’.  Please note - you are visiting the tropics and anywhere you stay in Hawaii you will likely see more insects than you do on the mainland. They are part of the eco-system and thankfully none are harmful. We feature Young Living Thieves brand all-natural soaps and cleaning products.   We use renewable bamboo paper products to reduce our impact on the environment as we strive to offer an eco-friendly home, featuring efficient appliances, lighting, recycling. Our tap water is supplied from the local purified rainwater so there is no need to bring bottled water. Please be sure to use Reef-safe sunblock during your stay in Kauai as well. We hope you love Kauai as much as we do and will make an effort to join us in these simple measures to protect this beautiful land.  Hale Aloha is locally family owned / managed so your stay will be supporting local residents here on the North Shore of Kauai. Our property manager lives just down the road in Haena and is available to ensure you have an unforgettable trip here on the Garden Isle.  Rates on Airbnb include all taxes / cleaning fees.
