Clean, comfortable, and freshly remodeled. Centrally located just north of downtown near major sports stadiums, restaurants, and museums. Travel to Houston's world renowned museum district, the Heights, the Texas Medical Center and the Galleria all less than 8 miles away. We provide complimentary coffee, tea, laundry soap, shampoo and conditioner!The spaceThe original home was built over 140 years ago in the 1880's  to house railroad workers. After our family immigrated from Sicily in 1942, they built a convenience store on the front of the house in the 1950s. They ran this store for 30 years and we are the 4th generation to live in the home. We remodeled this space from the studs and converted the old store into a studio apartment, which is why we affectionately call it the ""Storehouse Studio"". Every construction detail was specifically crafted with hosting guests in mind. The space is completely private and located in front of the main house, with only one external wall attached to the main roof. This 315 square foot studio is fully separate with a private entrance, a reserved off street parking space including all the amenities of home and is located on the ground floor. It includes a bathroom with garden soaking tub, washer and dryer, a kitchen complete with all necessary amenities including a gas stove, pots/pans/silverware, microwave, olive oil & spices, refrigerator with ice maker, a table for meals, a built in desk with a reading light and a main open bedroom area with a queen-size bed. An internet connected smart TV is already hooked up to our Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, ESPN and Amazon movie accounts. Or if you prefer, you can log into your personal accounts to stream videos. The A/C and heater are adjustable using a remote near the bed. Also, we have a dedicated WiFi hotspot for the studio and the password is sent to you once you book!","Kitchen**__**Fast wifi – 117 Mbps**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Free parking on premises**__**55"" TV with Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, premium cable",Entire guest suite hosted by Amber,"['Bathroom\nBathtub\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water\nShower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry\nFree washer – In unit\nFree dryer – In unit\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron\nClothing storage: closet', 'Entertainment\n55"" TV with Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, premium cable', 'Family\nPack ’n play/Travel crib\nOutlet covers', 'Heating and cooling\nCentral air conditioning\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nFast wifi – 117 Mbps\nVerified by speed test.

I love the outdoors, to read, good conversation, exploring and exercising - but also a good beer. I love mountain biking, cycling and travel!

Its central location in Houston makes it an excellent choice for a relaxing getaway. We think it's the best place to stay if you want to see and do everything the area has to offer in style and convenience. The time has come for you to be moved to action! You're in close proximity to some amazing places. Finally, a surefire way to unwind and have fun. Throughout the entire day.The spaceWhat is it about this suite that appeals to us so much? It has a straightforward design that allows for a maximum of six occupants. The walk-in closet has two air mattresses available for you to use if you find that you require them.You will immediately feel as comfortable as a cloud thanks to our sofa chair and futon that are designed in a vintage manner. We wanted our guests to feel like they were in a living room with family or friends, so we equipped the living room with standing food trays and a GIANT 55-inch Smart TV. Here, you can watch the latest shows, movies, and news, and you can even go on YouTube to learn new tik toks.We want our guests' most productive days to start with drinks made in our coffee maker or blender. We also keep silverware, pots, pans, plates, mugs, bowls, and cooking tools so that we can make the best home-cooked meals. What's the point of a nice suite if it doesn't have a great kitchen that's fully stocked?We want our guests to be able to get simple items without having to go far, so we decided to invest in a personal washer and dryer and provide expert maintenance support for it. This will ensure that your clothing are always clean and ready to be worn.It is much simpler to maintain the temperature exactly where you want it when you have a heating and cooling system that is centrally located.You can use our Keratin body wash and conditioner at any time of the day to calm and refresh your skin. Our luxury white towels wrap around your body, and our hand-made bathroom rug catches your feet before they hit the cold floor. Our full bathroom is equipped with toilet paper, eco-friendly hand soap, a classic vanity mirror, and a high-pressure shower head that can be removed.After a stressful day at work, you may unwind on our private patio during the day and turn on our highlighted flame light in the evening to transform the space into a more intimate setting that is ideal for romance or unwinding.You can keep your mind and body sharp by going to our gym, which is next to the pool area. Full of cardio and weight-lifting machines, so you can get in a solid exercise without being trapped in traffic or taking too much time away from your schedule.

Its central location in Houston makes it an excellent choice for a relaxing getaway. We think it's the best place to stay if you want to see and do everything the area has to offer in style and convenience. The time has come for you to be moved to action! You're in close proximity to some amazing places. Finally, a surefire way to unwind and have fun. Throughout the entire day.The spaceWhat is it about this suite that appeals to us so much? It has a straightforward design that allows for a maximum of six occupants. The walk-in closet has two air mattresses available for you to use if you find that you require them.You will immediately feel as comfortable as a cloud thanks to our sofa chair and futon that are designed in a vintage manner. We wanted our guests to feel like they were in a living room with family or friends, so we equipped the living room with standing food trays and a GIANT 55-inch Smart TV. Here, you can watch the latest shows, movies, and news, and you can even go on YouTube to learn new tik toks.We want our guests' most productive days to start with drinks made in our coffee maker or blender. We also keep silverware, pots, pans, plates, mugs, bowls, and cooking tools so that we can make the best home-cooked meals. What's the point of a nice suite if it doesn't have a great kitchen that's fully stocked?We want our guests to be able to get simple items without having to go far, so we decided to invest in a personal washer and dryer and provide expert maintenance support for it. This will ensure that your clothing are always clean and ready to be worn.It is much simpler to maintain the temperature exactly where you want it when you have a heating and cooling system that is centrally located.You can use our Keratin body wash and conditioner at any time of the day to calm and refresh your skin. Our luxury white towels wrap around your body, and our hand-made bathroom rug catches your feet before they hit the cold floor. Our full bathroom is equipped with toilet paper, eco-friendly hand soap, a classic vanity mirror, and a high-pressure shower head that can be removed.After a stressful day at work, you may unwind on our private patio during the day and turn on our highlighted flame light in the evening to transform the space into a more intimate setting that is ideal for romance or unwinding.You can keep your mind and body sharp by going to our gym, which is next to the pool area. Full of cardio and weight-lifting machines, so you can get in a solid exercise without being trapped in traffic or taking too much time away from your schedule.
