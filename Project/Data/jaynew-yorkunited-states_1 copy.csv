Plenty of space for 2-6 people on an adventure into the mountains available from September - early June.Firewood (only heat source) for purchase at the farm, bring sleeping bags and slippers for cold weather.  Our yurt is not a fully conditioned space, it's a somewhat insulated tent.  WINTER CAMPING EXPERIENCE - Plan accordingly, read the reviews, ask questions.The spacePlease make sure to read the entire listing for details.Its a 30' diameter yurt with 3 double hung windows and a plexiglass dome to allow natural light in.  There is electricity - kitchen lights, a few lamps and some string lights, a fridge,  and outlets in the kitchen and bedrooms.  There's a propane stovetop and counter tops inside with a propane grill outside.  Basic kitchen necessities for cooking/eating. Its a 40' path to a composting outhouse, just toss some wood shavings in after each use.  There is NO running water at the yurt - there is a 7 gallon water jug and a 2 gallon drinking jug that you can fill from the blue hydrant by the pump house across the driveway under WATER sign. (**lift all the way up and wait a few seconds for water to flow - see photos).   That space is for SUMMER USE ONLY.  Please never pour anything down the drains.There is a wood stove for heat - please READ the instruction page next to the stove, that is the only small heat source and will take a while to warm up and take the edge off.  Stove warms yurt to 40 degrees F above outside temp.  Firewood available for purchase at the farm or at the many roadside stands locally.  Depending on temperature, guests burn roughly $2-20/night.  Due to potentially invasive insects, please do not bring firewood from more than 50 miles away.THIS IS A CAMPING EXPERIENCE****The yurt has only basic insulation.  If staying with us in colder temperatures, you should be comfortable camping in the fall or winter and bring appropriate clothing, sleeping bags and gear for the temperatures.****  There is an electric blanket on the queen beed.  Please understand this is not a fully conditioned space, the wood stove can warm it up around 40-50 degrees F above the outside temp.  It is rustic, adventurous lodging - similar to renting a backcountry hut, except you can drive right up to it and its on a cool little farm with phenomenal views!
