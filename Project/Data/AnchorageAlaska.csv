We love St George and Alaska! Both places are both so drastically different, yet beautiful. My husband and I thoroughly enjoy hosting our guests in both locations, providing comfortable, fully equipped, special retreats!

You will let yourselves in with a keyless door code, but I am always available via phone or text, and usually available in town if you need anything!

Hi! I moved to Alaska from California and I absolutely love living in Alaska. I am a Realtor, interior designer and I own a beauty business in Anchorage. I love to go fishing in the summers and gardening is my favorite hobby.

Be close to many great Alaskan experiences while being able to relax and feel like you truly are in the last frontier and not just in another town. With moose right outside your window, the northern lights dancing above the roof and a fire crackling in the stove ,Glacier Breeze can give you a great sample of what makes Alaska so unique and awesome.The spaceThe 280 sq ft open floor plan cabin is delightfully set up for a comfortable stay for up to two people.  Perfect for a romantic getaway, an adventure home base or just an escape from the hustle of town. Or even all of the above! With Ted Stevens airport only one hour away,  the cabin also makes for great destination to start or end your trip to get a great nights sleep while getting that first, or final, taste of the tranquil Alaskan surroundings. With plenty of activities to do in the area, even in the winter, the cabin also makes for an excellent home base for an extended stay. Worried about being surprised by the cleaning fees and checkout chores?  You can already begin to relax!  We do not have a cleaning fee and the only thing we ask at check out is to make sure you have your stuff and to put the heat on low if it’s freezing out. After all, it’s you that’s here on vacation, not us! So what’s the cabin have to offer you? It may be a tiny cabin, but it’s loaded with comforts! The open floor plan living area has a comfortable love seat with entertainment provided via a TV loaded with several streaming services. If you would prefer some auditory entertainment, an Alexa speaker is waiting for your request for soothing tunes of your choice to further enhance the already relaxing atmosphere. Should you prefer to just unplug from the outside world you can choose from assorted board games or Alaskan themed books to chill out with. A wood stove with supplied firewood will keep you toasty through the chilly Alaskan nights , we will of coarse be glad to explain how to use it should you not be familiar with operating one. The full size memory foam Murphy bed is layered in soft, hypoallergenic and sustainably sourced bamboo sheets topped by a warm down alternative comforter. Add in the crackling sound of the wood slowly burning in the stove and you will for sure get a great nights sleep! Blackout blinds are installed on the windows for those not so dark summer Alaskan nights. The amply stocked kitchen includes a stove, full size refrigerator, Kureg and drip coffee pots, toaster, blender, crock pot, pans and the utensils you need to prepare your favorite meals.  Need something that’s not on hand, let us know and we may have it to bring out to the cabin for you to use.  Not up to cooking? We would be glad to recommend a local restaurant for what you are in the mood for. The Palmer area has some great locally owned restaurants, many that serve locally sourced foods. The private bathroom features a tub/shower combo with body wash, shampoo and conditioner provided. Fast 50mb Wifi is provided for your entertainment and work needs. Bear spray and bug spray are also supplied to help keep some of the more aggressive residents at bay while out exploring the area. Please do let us know if you use the bear spray so we can replace it with a new one for the next guests, and we aren’t going to lie, we would want to hear the story! As if all that was not all the reason you needed to stay at Glacier Breeze, the cabin is conveniently located nearby several popular attractions:Knik Glacier tours and winter fat tire bike access to glacier - 1 mile Knik Glacier Helicopter tours. Several glacier tour options, heli-skiing, heli-hiking, dog sledding on the glacier in the summer and custom tours to create your own adventure.   - 2 miles Pioneer Ridge trailhead - 4 miles 49th State Motor Tours - 13 milesReindeer Farm - 14 miles Alaska Horse Adventures - 14 milesPyrah’s Pioneer Peak Farm - 15 miles Musk Ox Farm - 21 miles Alaska Zipline Adventure Park - 23 milesHatcher Pass Area - 36 miles Snowhook Dogsledding, Snowmachine and ATV tours - 1 hour awayMatanuska Glacier Tours - 1 1/2 hour awayAnd much more to do as well that you can easily be relaxing back at the Glacier Breeze after a day of making lifelong memories. ** Special notes for winter: As you can imagine, Alaska requires some extra effort in the winter. We will do our absolute best to make sure that you have as easy of a time as possible with any weather mother nature may toss at us. If at anytime you have any concerns, please reach out to us and we will assist you the best we can!- If snow and ice are present, please use extra caution with footing. We do everything we can to provide for safe traction, but just like everywhere in Alaska in winter, it is a constant battle with mother nature! -Please remove any ice cleats before entering the cabin to prevent damage to floor. -There is a snow shovel and ice melt provided should you need it, though we will also clear snow as required, typically after around 3"" of new snow. Please understand that snow clearing operations in the area can occur at all hours of the day and night creating periodic noise.  - An extension cord is provided outside for plugging in vehicles, should temperatures make it necessary. -We recommend bringing some food just in case you need to wait for plows to clear the roads to get back to town.  It's a good idea to travel with some in your vehicle in general , in case you get stuck on the roadside somewhere.Most of all we pride ourselves on not just the great accommodations, but the high level of hospitality that comes along with your stay.

I'm originally from the east coast. Alaska is wonderful state to visit and explore. There aren't many places like it. I own a small business in Anchorage. I'm married with two small children. Feel free to reach out and ask questions.

There is no WiFi at this escape, yet you won't even notice with skiing, snowboarding, hiking, mountain biking, and so much more ready to keep you busy each day. You'll love being located in central Girdwood and minutes from Alyeska Resort!

When you find a bit of downtime inside, highlights include a cozy wood stove for cold winter nights, an expansive deck for summertime sunbathing or nighttime stargazing, and expansive windows that allow natural light and views of the surrounding trees to come in. Speaking of downtime, a vacation isn't complete without tasty meals, so bring along your favorite recipes to prepare in the full kitchen outfitted with all of the appliances and cookware you are used to. And, before hitting the hay, throw dirty clothes in the private washer and dryer to keep hiking and skiing apparel fresh for the next day's adventures.

This is your ticket to get back to the simpler times and bask in the mountain lifestyle!

We are travelers too and this is our home base. Why stay here? You'll love it for the reasons we do: Outdoor space like you're far away from the hustle yet a location that gives easy access to heart of the city. The yard is major and there's a HOT TUB on a deck, fire pit, dreamy string lights AND your own carport!  Inside you have a fireplace, giant windows, a big bed, fast wifi & a travel centric vibe. Here you will find authenticity, atmosphere & attention to detail. Welcome.The space--- Overview:o	Idyllic Travelers Home base for all seasons; super cozy in the winter, lots of outdoor living space in the summer. o	Central location to easily gain access to the highlights and necessities of this city and Great State!o	Great for couples, singles, small families o	Entire ground level duplex unito	Private driveway, carport and entrywayo	Full, open kitchen with all the goods. Gas stove/oveno	Cozy living room with luxurious velvet couch and big picture windowso	Wood burning fireplace o	King bed and luxury linenso	Fast fiber interneto	Classic Alaskan, Mid Century and international travel design vibeso	Huge, fully fenced, treed yard with fire pit and string lightso	Outdoor HOT TUB includedo	Minutes from the airporto	Biking/walking/skiing paths right out fronto	Close to restaurants, groceries and attractionso	In-depth details follow, please reach out with questions. Our goal is that your stay is a great fit for you and our home. o	We look forward to having you!   	                        Get to know us! Read on:--- THE HOUSE:Our home is an upper/lower duplex built into the hillside with private entry points; one at street level and one around below.The construction of the home was completed the year prior to the great earthquake of '64 and it rode through it like a champ. In fact, this house became the haven for neighbors who’s homes weren’t so lucky (so we were told). Now, while you rest easy with the knowledge of this house’s Earthquake sustainability please don’t judge its quirks too harshly. Where it falls short, it more than makes up for it in mid century modern charm and character. If you appreciate details, you've come to the right place. When updating and styling we let the house do its own talking and then added some of our stories collected in pictures and art from travels afar. Our mini library offers some vintage Alaskana editions and our personal collection of Lonely Planet guidebooks is there to inspire future wanderings. In the bedroom you have space to hang your clothes or fold them away in the dresser if you’re not the type who just flings open the duffel bag and calls it good. A brand new KING BED commands the room nicely. One thing we’ll always love about hotels is their luxurious white cotton sheets. So that’s what you’ll find here as well, in a thread count of 600 to be exact. Something that is often overlooked in a hotel room: Great coffee! Our local roaster, Kaladi, is amazing and you get to be the judge of that yourself using the drip coffee maker or the pour over system. We have sugar and creamers and some tea options for your morning pleasure. And the shower has you covered with big bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The large open kitchen has everything you need to cook-in or plate and reheat your to-go meals. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some important things for your consideration: - Don't see your preferred dates available? Reach out! We are last minute travelers ourselves and can sometimes flex our availability. - Are you a fellow Alaskan coming through the city on a supply run? We have lots of room to explode your shopping, pack, repack and shop again. - We are a young family and we welcome yours. If you have a baby or toddler we can set you up with a lot of things… Also our huge yard is full of toys and play-sets and it’s fully fenced except for the driveway. Just give us a heads up if you are bringing littles. - This space is well suited for up to two adults sharing the bedroom. Children can also be accommodated with floor mat style sleeping arrangements or a pack n play. - We do not have a TV or Dishwasher. We do have great, high speed wifi.- The bathroom is small (shower, no tub) but clean and bright and gets the job done. - This is an upper/lower style duplex. You may hear foot traffic if we are home. We live upstairs, however, in the summer we are in the bush most of the time and in the winter we travel regularly. We are respectful of the quiet hours and please do let us know in advance of your arrival if you have specific concerns about noise.- The fireplace can be used with long burning Duraflame style logs only. One log will be provided for your stay and you can purchase additional logs at local grocery stores. - This unit does not have access to a washer and dryer, however, there are lots of options locally including a same day pick up and delivery service!--- THE OUTSIDE:Our property covers three city lots, an unusual amount of space for this part of town. The yard is expansive and in addition to ornamental and wild foliage, we have apple trees, raspberries and rhubarb plants which you are welcome to help yourself to in season. You won’t see the neighbors or the street as a hillside, trees, green belt and fencing all create incredible privacy. It really feels like out of city living while still being able to enjoy the benefits of having everything super close by. The Fish Creek Estuary runs right next to us and so does the Fish Creek Trail. Yes, we have a HOT TUB! It’s on a separate deck built into the hillside overlooking the yard which is adorned with dreamy string lights. The tub is shared with us in the upstairs unit and you are welcome to enjoy it! There will be detailed use instructions and rules listed inside the home. We all want to enjoy a clean and safe spa so use of the hot tub is contingent on your agreement to abide by our rules and instructions.",Garden view**__**Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Free carport on premises – 1 space,Entire home hosted by Ellie,"['Scenic views\nGarden view', 'Bathroom\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nBody soap\nHot water\nShower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nCotton White, crisp and luxurious 600 thread count pure cotton linens\nClothing storage: dresser and closet', 'Entertainment\nBooks and reading material', 'Family\nCrib - available upon request\nMini (38 inches long x 24 inches wide), sheets provided\nPack ’n play/Travel crib - available upon request\nChildren’s books and toys for ages 0-2 years old\nStandalone high chair - available upon request\nWith straps/harness\nChildren’s dinnerware', 'Heating and cooling\nIndoor fireplace: wood-burning\nPortable fans\nRadiant heating', 'Home safety\nSecurity cameras on property\nFor all of our safety and property protection we have cameras, outdoors only.

Fish or float the creek which runs through our property! You’ll love our place because of the outdoors space, located on Campbell Creek with bike/running trail access. Experience the serenity of Alaska while being in the center of it all! If this unit is booked during your desired time, check out its sister unit The Creek House #4The spaceFrom the road our property is marked with a white address pole, the building is tucked away and it’s easy to miss the first time. When you pull in you will see the green building and 4 tan doors with several parking spaces in front of the doors. One parking spot is reserved and clearly marked for the permanent tenant. Once you get out of the vehicle you will walk through the gate to be greeted by the beautiful yard and garden space with the tranquil creek flowing through it. This creek can be fished, floated, swam in, or just enjoyed.  On the weekends, we usually see friendly folks floating the creek.  Additionally, we are directly on Anchorages famous Campbell Creek trail system that can take you anywhere in the city using paved walking and bike paths.  We are located directly in the middle of Anchorage, making it convenient to go anywhere from here, with activities in all directions.   Only about a 5 minutes cab ride from the airport, and 15 minutes to anywhere in town. You’ll enter the building through a coral entry door all four units share this common arctic entry. Each unit has its own private door to enter into it. All of our doors have coded locks so you never have to worry about keys. There will be six stairs to get to your apartment. Once you enter your apartment you will walk into the living room that’s decorated to be stylish and comfortable. In the kitchen you’ll find all the essentials to make and enjoy meal together. We supply coffee, creamer and sugar as well as most cooking spices. There are two bedrooms with queen beds and one bathroom. We supply all linens, pillows etc. You’ll need to bring your own charging cords. We supply towels, soap, shampoo and conditioner as well as a hair dryer. In the hall closet you’ll find fishing poles for use but you’ll need to provide your own bait and you can purchase a fishing license online at Alaska.gov. We also have a stock of board games for your enjoyment.We have a bbq and picnic area as well as several fire pit areas and s’more sticks. Please enjoy the space responsibly :) A few things to remember.  This is in a 4 unit apartment and people live in the above units, so you may hear walking and doors shutting. We provide you with fans in the unit to create white noise for light sleepers.  It is also next to a street that gives easy access to the rest of the city.  That means when you are outside, you will hear the sound of cars driving by, but that unfortunately cannot be avoided when staying in the city.  All the windows are new, which eliminates the loud noises when all the windows are closed. The airport is currently under runway renovations and one of the temporary flight paths is over our property do you may hear or see planes. Alaska has the largest small plane usage than any other state as it’s one of the best and sometimes only ways to get around up here, so anywhere you stay in Anchorage you will see and hear air traffic. Well behaved dogs are welcome, and there are dogs and a 'guard cat' on premises, all very friendly to people and other doggos. You are responsible for letting us know if you will be bringing a pet, cleaning up after your pet and for any damage your pet may cause. Having a pet at our property means you are assuming all liability for your pet while on the premises. We also charge a pet fee of $15/day. The unit is not ""baby proofed"" but meets all building and safety regulations and codes. We welcome families but want you to be aware that it’s not child proofed. Onsite laundry is coin operated.If this place is booked during your desired times, check out our other units, The Creek House #4 & The Creek House #1So bring you’re adventurous spirit, clothes, charging cords and toothbrush and prepare to have a great experience with us!

Fish or float the creek which runs through our property! You’ll love our place because of the outdoors space, located on Campbell Creek with bike/running trail access. Experience the serenity of Alaska while being in the center of it all! If this unit is booked during your desired time, check out its sister unit The Creek House #4The spaceFrom the road our property is marked with a white address pole, the building is tucked away and it’s easy to miss the first time. When you pull in you will see the green building and 4 tan doors with several parking spaces in front of the doors. One parking spot is reserved and clearly marked for the permanent tenant. Once you get out of the vehicle you will walk through the gate to be greeted by the beautiful yard and garden space with the tranquil creek flowing through it. This creek can be fished, floated, swam in, or just enjoyed.  On the weekends, we usually see friendly folks floating the creek.  Additionally, we are directly on Anchorages famous Campbell Creek trail system that can take you anywhere in the city using paved walking and bike paths.  We are located directly in the middle of Anchorage, making it convenient to go anywhere from here, with activities in all directions.   Only about a 5 minutes cab ride from the airport, and 15 minutes to anywhere in town. You’ll enter the building through a coral entry door all four units share this common arctic entry. Each unit has its own private door to enter into it. All of our doors have coded locks so you never have to worry about keys. There will be six stairs to get to your apartment. Once you enter your apartment you will walk into the living room that’s decorated to be stylish and comfortable. In the kitchen you’ll find all the essentials to make and enjoy meal together. We supply coffee, creamer and sugar as well as most cooking spices. There are two bedrooms with queen beds and one bathroom. We supply all linens, pillows etc. You’ll need to bring your own charging cords. We supply towels, soap, shampoo and conditioner as well as a hair dryer. In the hall closet you’ll find fishing poles for use but you’ll need to provide your own bait and you can purchase a fishing license online at Alaska.gov. We also have a stock of board games for your enjoyment.We have a bbq and picnic area as well as several fire pit areas and s’more sticks. Please enjoy the space responsibly :) A few things to remember.  This is in a 4 unit apartment and people live in the above units, so you may hear walking and doors shutting. We provide you with fans in the unit to create white noise for light sleepers.  It is also next to a street that gives easy access to the rest of the city.  That means when you are outside, you will hear the sound of cars driving by, but that unfortunately cannot be avoided when staying in the city.  All the windows are new, which eliminates the loud noises when all the windows are closed. The airport is currently under runway renovations and one of the temporary flight paths is over our property do you may hear or see planes. Alaska has the largest small plane usage than any other state as it’s one of the best and sometimes only ways to get around up here, so anywhere you stay in Anchorage you will see and hear air traffic. Well behaved dogs are welcome, and there are dogs and a 'guard cat' on premises, all very friendly to people and other doggos. You are responsible for letting us know if you will be bringing a pet, cleaning up after your pet and for any damage your pet may cause. Having a pet at our property means you are assuming all liability for your pet while on the premises. We also charge a pet fee of $15/day. The unit is not ""baby proofed"" but meets all building and safety regulations and codes. We welcome families but want you to be aware that it’s not child proofed. Onsite laundry is coin operated.If this place is booked during your desired times, check out our other units, The Creek House #4 & The Creek House #1So bring you’re adventurous spirit, clothes, charging cords and toothbrush and prepare to have a great experience with us!

From the moment you walk into our thoughtfully decorated Alaskan villa, we want you to feel at home! The home is equipped with one king bed (master bedroom), two queen beds (each in their own separate bedroom), and two twin beds (both placed in one bedroom). Additionally, we've provided an extra sleeping option (for a total of 6 beds in the home) with a foldable roll-away twin bed (and memory foam mattress) - we'll let your group play ‘rock, paper, scissors’ for who sleeps where! If you want to ""work from home,"" we've provided many ways to make your work pass by quickly! The home features the latest internet technology with a 2-gigabit internet connection, coupled with a super fast WiFi 6E Router. This means that you will be able to experience WiFi Speeds of up to 1.8gbps down, and 50mbps up. Or, if you're lucky and are truly on vacation, you can  completely disconnect by relaxing with a cup of coffee, cocktail, or a bowl of popcorn while enjoying the great Alaskan outdoors outside on the home's spacious deck.

Although we don't offer cable, each TV features smart TV options. We provide complimentary access to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+. You are welcome to login to any other service that you personally pay for. While the home is equipped to host 10 people, we think the perfect group size is 7-8. We're happy to host all 10, but keep in mind it is a little cozier as it's a 2100 square foot home. We take the sanitation and cleaning procedures of our home very seriously.

After 30 years I like to call myself an Alaskan. Coming from a big family I’ve always had a heart for catering and hosting others. I hope that comes across in all my Encounters with our guests.
