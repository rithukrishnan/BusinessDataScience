The Coconut Cottage is a place where only the best memories are made! Built in the 1930's, it has all the cute charm of simpler times combined with the convenience of modern amenities.  The cottage is just perfect for family, friends, or even solo travelers looking for a beautiful place to stay that's close to everything!  The property is 5 minutes to downtown and 20 minutes to the beach (traffic dependent).The spaceComing in at around 400 square feet, this pleasantly-old-fashioned space has a cozy warmth with an eclectic touch.  The cottage is in a little Caribbean inspired complex adoringly named The Wanderlust Cottages.  You'll love it for a romantic getaway, a sweet vacation with someone special, or your family vacation.  Please note: the space is quaint.  The bedrooms are adjoining, and the bathroom is accessed through the master bedroom.    We wanted to keep the place open and airy despite its modest size.  P.S: You may occasionally hear the rumble and catch a glimpse of Americas most coveted flying force: The Blue Angels!

Outside, there is a great private seating area  under the tree.","Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Free parking on premises**__**40"" HDTV with standard cable**__**Air conditioning",Entire guesthouse hosted by Dom And Kels,"['Bathroom\nHair dryer\nShampoo\nHot water\nShower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nIron', 'Entertainment\n40"" HDTV with standard cable', 'Family\nCrib\nChildren’s dinnerware', 'Heating and cooling\nAir conditioning\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSmoke alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nFire extinguisher\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nWifi', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nCoffee maker', 'Location features\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nPrivate backyard – Fully fenced\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nOutdoor furniture\nOutdoor dining area\nBeach essentials\nBeach towels, umbrella, beach blanket, snorkeling gear', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises', 'Services\nSelf check-in\nSmart lock\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Security cameras on property\nSecurity cameras on property\nUnavailable: Washer\nWasher']","['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/9039be06-99c6-4544-b259-e4cafad35687.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/94b736c2-3269-462e-b864-66e6ac984311.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/93ec5ced-51a2-4158-a013-0251f7b69334.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/6682abcd-6bd3-4fb3-9cf3-2d7621c1bd5c.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/c543093c-de56-483c-87b6-9f31efc29e6a.jpg']","Hosted by Dom And Kels

The master bedroom has a tv, each side of both rooms' beds have plugs within easy reach, and the wifi signal is strong throughout the house. The backyard is open and a bit overgrown, but that's just more fun for the kids. It's a quiet street, but also within earshot of the railroad tracks so you can hear the train horn at times. There is a security camera at the front door for extra peace of mind. You're free to arrive at anytime with keypad entry.

Modern amenities meet coastal charm in this shotgun bungalow, built in 1901. What's with the name?! Our sweet pup, Penny Lane, absolutely LOVED putting her paws in the sand and frolicking in the salty waves of the ocean. Penny remains with us in spirit & Salty Dog is a tribute to  her love for the sun, salt & sand. We hope you'll enjoy your stay on the Emerald Coast at Salty Dog Cottage. P'cola welcomes you!The spaceEnjoy a completely private, beautifully designed home for your stay in Pensacola. Salty Dog Cottage has been lovingly restored & thoughtfully designed to embrace the character of a 1901 home while offering modern amenities. You'll enjoy 570 sq ft of light & airy sun-filled space, soaring ceilings, a cozy living room with a convertible sofa bed, bedroom w/ king size green tea mattress, organic toiletries & full sized washer & dryer. While there is plentiful natural light, both the bedroom & living room have room darkening fabric lined curtains for mornings you may want to sleep-in. For cozy nights in, cook a fresh meal in the open concept kitchen. Feel free to cut sprigs of fresh rosemary from the front garden to garnish your meal (or cocktail). For a low-key stay-at-home night, kick back on your sofa for a night of Netflix on your Roku TV. Coming back from the beach, have an invigorating rinse in your outdoor shower that boasts hot AND cold water! Relax outdoors on the quaint front porch in your adirondack chairs or enjoy al fresco dining out back. Convenient keyless entry via the smart lock makes self check-in a breeze. Play Pandora or pair your phone to the Alexa speaker to listen to some tunes. Video doorbells in both the front exterior and rear exterior of the property offer home video/audio monitoring.

I’m a story lover. I love hearing, watching, and reading stories. I believe every is living in their own story, and they have some interesting experiences to share with the world. I would love to use my house to help share stories.

I want to meet interesting people, and hear their stories, but I also understand that not everyone wants to sit down on the couch and make a new friend. Please don’t feel pressured to be social or share a life story.

Born and raised in Austin, TX. In 2016 I made the move to Pensacola and have been enjoying the beach life since. I’ve been using Airbnb to travel since it’s beginning days and started hosting on it here in Pensacola in 2018.

If some rust on the 70 year old bathtub, old windows, original wood flooring or other ""historic home"" flaws will bother you then I suggest you not rent this unit as uncomfortable stays by a guest end up in horrible negative reviews and low stars for owners whether fair or not, the owner looses out in major review hits.

The master bedroom has a tv, each side of both rooms' beds have plugs within easy reach, and the wifi signal is strong throughout the house.

Tastefully decorated, relaxing space with abundant natural light. Delight in luxurious white marble countertops, beautiful decor & soft velvety linens. No seashell decor in this cottage! Convenient location near downtown, East Hill, Hwy & only 15 mins to beachThe space*Please note* this is a tiny home located in a very old East Pensacola neighborhood. While many homes around are being renovated and new homes are being built everyday, many families and seniors in the neighborhood have lived there for generations. This isn't San Fransisco, it's Old Pensacola. Pensacola has it's own flavor, history and culture. Tiny homes are different from regular houses. The washer/dryer takes longer than a regular full size machine, the tankless hot water heater runs on propane and may need to be swapped out during your stay, etc. I like the wild vines & palms that grows around the house so it's not perfectly manicured. If you're looking for a pristine million dollar house in a perfectly curated neighborhood, you may not like the vibe. I own the 100+year old home in front which is an airbnb as well. Tiny home sits on the location of another home that was torn down years ago. It's not impossible you could see small pieces of broken glass, bricks or old nails in the yard the house. 200 sqft living space +queen size bed in the upstairs loft. Tiny home is equipped with a kitchenette with mini refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster, convection microwave, dishes, glassware and silverware. There is a small gas grill on the patio.Tiny living doesn't mean you can't enjoy a roomy bathroom with tub/shower. Towels & some toiletries provided. Enjoy a private fenced yard & patio area with small propane grill. Yard is surrounded by 50 yr old camellias, towering oak trees & tropical palms. Beach chairs and cooler available for you to borrow. Private & on street parking available and WiFi is provided.","Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Free parking on premises**__**32"" HDTV with Netflix, Roku**__**Unavailable: Carbon monoxide alarmCarbon monoxide alarm",Tiny home hosted by Shanna,"['Bathroom\nBathtub\nHair dryer\nCleaning products\nShampoo\nConditioner\nHot water\nShower gel', 'Bedroom and laundry\nFree washer – In unit\nFree dryer – In unit\nEssentials\nTowels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\nHangers\nBed linens\nExtra pillows and blankets\nRoom-darkening shades\nIron\nDrying rack for clothing\nClothing storage: wardrobe', 'Entertainment\n32"" HDTV with Netflix, Roku\nBooks and reading material', 'Heating and cooling\nCentral air conditioning\nCeiling fan\nPortable fans\nHeating', 'Home safety\nSecurity cameras on property\nRing security light on the driveway\nSmoke alarm\nFirst aid kit', 'Internet and office\nWifi\nDedicated workspace\nIn a common space', 'Kitchen and dining\nKitchen\nSpace where guests can cook their own meals\nRefrigerator\nMicrowave\nCooking basics\nPots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\nDishes and silverware\nBowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\nMini fridge\nFreezer\nCoffee maker: Keurig coffee machine\nWine glasses\nToaster\nBlender\nBarbecue utensils\nGrill, charcoal, bamboo skewers/iron skewers, etc.\nCoffee', 'Location features\nPrivate entrance\nSeparate street or building entrance', 'Outdoor\nPrivate patio or balcony\nPrivate backyard – Fully fenced\nAn open space on the property usually covered in grass\nOutdoor furniture\nHammock\nOutdoor dining area\nBBQ grill\nBeach essentials\nBeach towels, umbrella, beach blanket, snorkeling gear', 'Parking and facilities\nFree parking on premises\nFree street parking', 'Services\nLong term stays allowed\nAllow stay for 28 days or more\nSelf check-in\nLockbox', 'Not included\nUnavailable: Carbon monoxide alarm\nCarbon monoxide alarm\nHost has indicated no carbon monoxide detector is necessary.

Book now to come chill, grill or enjoy a thrill!The spaceRight between paradise and paradise, the pictures truly DO NOT do this peaceful home away from home justice.Not only is this place immaculate and like new inside, it’s in a location that puts you only a short drive from Navarre Beach (11 miles) or Pensacola Beach (12 miles), a slightly longer, but still reasonable distance from Destin, and also near Downtown Pensacola night life, dining, shopping and sports. This cozy, well appointed home has a spacious feel, and comes equipped with all the comforts of home and luxuries of somewhere special! Stroll out back you’ll find peace and tranquillity 24/7 and you see nothing but the beauty of nature while you feel the gentle bay breeze and hear the sounds of birds singing. You'll get an enchanted feeling as you hear the gentle song of the wind chimes out back as well. At night you can stargaze over the gorgeous Florida wetlands and you will feel you’re the only person around for miles. Grill steaks, seafood, and veggies, or gather around the fire pit on the cooler nights after a long day on the beach or boating. In the garage you’ll find classic arcade consoles that will feel like you warped to the 80s or 90s. There’s also a nice metal detector if you want to try your hand at finding treasure on the nearby Woodlawn Beach boat ramp area or out on the island.1 King, 2 queens gives space for 6 or more comfortably and you can rest assured that everything has been throughly cleaned and sanitized. Here's a few things you won't find at all properties:1. All beds, pillows and bedding are new with allergen mattress protectors, pillow protectors and bedding is always sanitized and washed. 2. We offer a couple of complimentary bikes (for around the neighborhood) and SUPs/kayaks if you have a way to safely and carefully transport. Additional for rent at very low rates. 3. Nice quiet neighborhood and private end of the road property. 4. Bay/Boat ramp very close by!5. Movies, board games, arcade machines, foosball and basketball shooting game.6.

The backyard oasis boasts a large inground pool and cabana. The owners have thought of everything to make this space both extremely kid-friendly, yet romantic for the adults. With its ideal setting just across the bridge from the beach, you'll be able to avoid most of the traffic on Hwy. 98.  Come enjoy this home thoughtfully designed with next-level care!The spaceLiving Spaces

As you enter the front hall with its gleaming hardwood floors, and thoughtful side tables for keys, wallets, and purses, the first thing you’ll notice is living spaces that manage to be both stylish and luxurious, while still maintaining an inviting and family-friendly atmosphere. 

The cozy living room is found adjacent to the generous, family-sized kitchen. Its decor is Beachy Luxe - a delightful combination of soothing neutral shades, with bright pops of complementary colors and decor. 

Sink into either the L-shaped sofa or one of the two cozy side chairs. Perhaps you’ll want to stream your favorite shows or movies on the Smart TV w/high-speed WiFi. If not, curl up with a good book. Or maybe challenge a family member to one of the many board games, or even try your hand at a puzzle. 

If this is a working vacation, take advantage of our dedicated work area with a chair, charging station, and enough room for your printer. 

Additional Amenities:

Oversized Jenga
Oversized Connect 4
Oversized family dice game
Multiple puzzles and board games
Florida-opoly (similar to Monopoly)

Children’s books and toys

Cooking & Dining

The gorgeous kitchen will no doubt tempt even the most reluctant chef! This ultra-modern space features all the amenities you’ve come to expect in a luxury home. From stainless steel appliances to solid-surface countertops, to pendant lighting, to a long kitchen island with seating for 4, this fully-equipped kitchen has everything you might need to create even the most demanding and intricate recipes. 

The formal dining room is elegant and inviting, with a timeless sideboard displayed neatly against the wall, a beautiful chandelier tucked into the trayed ceiling and coastal artwork on the walls. Not only will it be a pleasure to dine in style here, it may even inspire you to create a new family tradition of dining together with conversation and laughter instead of electronic devices. 

Other kitchen/dining amenities include: 

Bread maker
Rice maker
Instapot
Wok
Griddle
Pampered Chef popcorn maker
Large bowls
Kids cups/sippy cups
Pizza cutter
Keurig w/starter set of coffee pods and creamer

Sleeping Accommodations and Bathrooms

The Wandering Turtle offers 3 bedrooms (each with a Smart TV) and accommodations for up to 10 guests. 

Taking advantage of a split bedroom plan, the master suite is at the other end of the home from the two other bedrooms. As parents ourselves, we wanted to create a “vacation within a vacation” ambiance for this space. It’s been outfitted with a romantic 4-poster king-sized bed and a corner armchair with its own eclectic light and side table, perfect for reading or just relaxing. The artwork is colorful and cheerful. The big soaking tub in the master bath offers a pampering treat, which every parent so richly deserves! Other features in this spa-like space include dual vanities.  

The second bedroom is the children’s lair, with its triple bunk bed (with 3 twin mattresses), and a truly innovative bean bag that opens up into a double bed (see how it works here). Now they can all pile up together for a vacation-long sleepover party!
This room also serves as the game room, with an old-style digital arcade, featuring more than 399 games. You may never see the kids at all during vacation.

The third bedroom has a double bed with a twin trundle. A distinctive mermaid mural makes this a uniquely styled sanctuary. When you’ve finished watching the Smart TV or listening to your favorite tunes on Alexa, you’ll feel like you’re drifting off to sleep in an underwater retreat. 

The second and third bedrooms share a full hall bath with a tub/shower.

Additional Amenities for Beds/Baths:

Extra towels, linens, pillows, blankets 
Baby monitor
Personal fans for bunk beds
Shampoo, conditioner, body wash
Hair dryer
Starter set of toilet paper

Outdoor Amenities

This backyard oasis was built for family fun and memory-making. Just steps out the back door is the large free-form pool, with a shallow toddler area and a fun tiki umbrella. In case the kids want to stay on dry land, there’s still plenty of fun to be had! There’s a playhouse to explore and a big, fenced yard to exhaust themselves in.  

Interested in a lazy day lounging around the pool? There’s no better way to do that than relaxing in the covered cabana, complete with a cozy chaise lounge for two. 

Enjoy your meals al fresco at the outdoor dining table for 6, while enjoying the freshly grilled fish (or good ol’ burgers and dogs) from the gas grill. 

Additional Amenities:

Starter set of swim diapers for smaller kids
Firepit starter set of wood and lighter
Floats for pool

Step up to the front porch, rock beside your favorite person, and enjoy the serene views of this peaceful Seville Historic Neighborhood in Downtown Pensacola.    The cottage and grounds is your exclusive space  - no shared spaces.  Explore all the goodness Downtown offers - restaurants, shops, parks, nightlife & museums within 5-10 minutes from Caroline Cottage by foot. Close enough for convenience, far enough for a restful stay. Similar to the size of a cabin it is 870 sq. ft. of Bliss:  Indoors, the high ceilings, and thoughtful details make this home friendly and elegant —ideal for weddings, family, or couples' vacations.  Private bedrooms separate from the living spaces make the cottage a great place to entertain company.The spaceTHE SPACE:  Caroline Cottage is a sentimental place named after its prior owner, Caroline Presti.  Although she never lived in it, Caroline loved this cottage, and I managed the property for her over the years as an annual rental (I am her son and biggest fan).  She was married for over 50 years to the love of her life, Joseph Presti, and she was happiest when they were together.  On the walls in the living area are a few snapshots of the couple early on in their sentimental journey.THE GREAT OUTDOORS:    This two-bedroom, one-bath single-story cottage is your private residence  with plenty of outdoor space. We all need a place to step outside, breathe in the fresh air, get a dose of Vitamin D and unwind. We gave our outside spaces and gardens a lot of love. You’ll particularly enjoy the exterior dining areas and porch rockers where you can relax for an evening sip on your favorite beverage or relax for a peaceful retreat.As your health and well-being are important, you will have immediate access to purified H2O—no need for bottled water. Under the kitchen sink is a Reverse Osmosis System (ROS, a water purification process) dispensed by a separate faucet beside the kitchen sink.CLEANLINESS:  We pride ourselves on our meticulous attention to detail — so you can trust we will fulfill the highest level of cleanliness. And, with well over 100 guest stays, our vacation cottages have an average cleaning review score of 5 stars. For those physical folks, enjoy your visit and stay fit with FREE access to the local gym, Anytime Fitness, for up to 4 guests (access fobs are onsite and permit two guests each).  It is a 24-hr gym, located 3 minutes by foot, complete with cardio equipment, free weights, and weight machines.  Starter provisions (generally enough for three days) include Keurig coffee pods, teas, condiments, treats, cleaning products, and detergent pods for the washer and dishwasher.  Longer stay visitors, please make yourselves at home, and you will most likely need to purchase additional provisions.  Enjoy your stay and be sure to visit the many sites and attractions afforded to you in this Historic Neighborhood.

Walk mere steps out to the beach, or kick back on the furnished deck overlooking the bay and take it all in. After a fun day on the beach, you can come back to watch a good movie or show on the living area's TV.

Mix a beverage or prepare a sumptuous meal in the trendy full kitchen. You'll have helpful extras like a microwave, a full-size coffee maker, and ample counter space, and you can serve your dinner guests at the dining room table with seating for four while the kids chatter away from the two breakfast bar stools. Each bedroom has a ceiling fan and private balcony, with the main bedroom also featuring a swing. Central air-conditioning will keep everyone cool inside. When you're ready for a new activity, guests can enjoy access to an outdoor pool right next door to the townhouse and an outdoor shower to help with going from the pool to the beach and back. A sofa bed in the living room offers extra sleeping space.

WHAT’S NEARBY
Public beach access on the Gulf side is just across the street, but that's just the beginning! The bay may be more suitable for families with small children. Gulf Island National Seashore offers sand castle-worthy sand just under six miles away to the northeast. Langdon Beach is just under six miles away to the west, set within the historical Fort Pickens attractions. If you're looking to get out onto the water, Jolly Sailing and Dolphin Cruise offers tours and cruises just over two miles away.
