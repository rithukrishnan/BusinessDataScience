Love traveling, good food and good people.

I travel a lot and love going to new places. I know how important it is at the end of the day to have a nice place to sleep, a hot shower and a soft bed with a comfortable atmosphere.

I live in Romania but visit Florida often. I always stay in my own apartments, and I furnish them for guests just like I want them when I stay myself.

Enjoy your stay in Florida!

Enjoy your stay in Florida!

I live in Romania but visit Florida often. I always stay in my own apartments, and I furnish them for guests just like I want them when I stay myself.

Enjoy your stay in Florida!

I live in Europe, so it's strictly through email. You will get the key in a lockbox.

Love traveling, good food and good people.

I travel a lot and love going to new places. I know how important it is at the end of the day to have a nice place to sleep, a hot shower and a soft bed with a comfortable atmosphere.

Quiet, family friendly location. The Area Hollywood Beach Golf Club is a public course and is 1.5 miles away. Downtown Hollywood is just 1.5 miles south, about a 15 min walk. There you will find young circle with a performing arts auditorium, many restaurants, shopping, Publix supermarket and club/lounges.   Hollywood Beach is just 3.5 miles away. There you will find the famous Hollywood Broadwalk. Along it are dozens of restaurants and shops. You can rent bicycles and ride the beautiful 3 mile long paved stretch. Margaritaville is at the center of the Broadwalk with a stimulated surfing ride and a public music auditorium that has live music Thursday through Saturday. TipsDownload the Ride Circuit ap. If you walk 1 block south to Polk St, it will pick you up there (0.5miles away) For $2 per person it will take you anywhere in downtown or anywhere on the beach. I suggest even taken this to the beach on weekends as Parking is difficult and expensive.From Margaritaville you can get access to the free Fort Lauderdale Water taxi service that travels throughout our beautiful intercoastal water ways.Living here for almost all my life, I suggest you read my guidebook to see the best offerings my city has.","Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Free parking on premises**__**50"" HDTV with Apple TV, Roku",Entire rental unit hosted by Yuly,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/b528cbda-8047-4026-a0f7-0d0a17c52002.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/a9f0b687-2942-4522-8de7-8ec4daf2af8c.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/bc1ea43a-f0a4-4b1f-b00e-68eefbc94cca.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/83587406-3224-4960-a4af-b584f8591223.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/dcd5f835-31cc-4bcf-b7a2-96a0874c8c42.jpg']","Hosted by Yuly

Margaritaville is at the center of the Broadwalk with a stimulated surfing ride and a public music auditorium that has live music Thursday through Saturday. TipsDownload the Ride Circuit ap. If you walk 1 block south to Polk St, it will pick you up there (0.5miles away) For $2 per person it will take you anywhere in downtown or anywhere on the beach. I suggest even taken this to the beach on weekends as Parking is difficult and expensive.From Margaritaville you can get access to the free Fort Lauderdale Water taxi service that travels throughout our beautiful intercoastal water ways.Living here for almost all my life, I suggest you read my guidebook to see the best offerings my city has.","Kitchen**__**Wifi**__**Dedicated workspace**__**Free parking on premises**__**50"" HDTV with Apple TV, Roku",Entire rental unit hosted by Yuly,[],"['https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/b528cbda-8047-4026-a0f7-0d0a17c52002.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/a9f0b687-2942-4522-8de7-8ec4daf2af8c.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/bc1ea43a-f0a4-4b1f-b00e-68eefbc94cca.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/83587406-3224-4960-a4af-b584f8591223.jpg', 'https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/dcd5f835-31cc-4bcf-b7a2-96a0874c8c42.jpg']","Hosted by Yuly

I live in Romania but visit Florida often. I always stay in my own apartments, and I furnish them for guests just like I want them when I stay myself.

Enjoy your stay in Florida!
During your stay
I live in Europe, so all communication will be by email. In case of emergencies, I have a professional property manager who lives just a mile away.

Love traveling, good food and good people.

I travel a lot and love going to new places. I know how important it is at the end of the day to have a nice place to sleep, a hot shower and a soft bed with a comfortable atmosphere.

I live in Romania but visit Florida often. I always stay in my own apartments, and I furnish them for guests just like I want them when I stay myself.

Enjoy your stay in Florida!
During your stay
I live in Europe, so all non-emergency communication needs to go through Airbnb's messaging system. I have a local property manager who lives two miles away in case of emergencies. You will get the key in a lockbox.

I live in Romania but visit Florida often. I always stay in my own apartments, and I furnish them for guests just like I want them when I stay myself.

Enjoy your stay in Florida!
During your stay
I live in Romania so all non-emergency communication needs to be by email. For emergencies I have a property manager who lives less than a mile away.
