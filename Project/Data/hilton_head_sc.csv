Walk or bike less than a half-mile to Coligny Circle for a plethora of dining and shopping options, convenient amenities, and recreation at Coligny Beach Park and the Coligny Plaza Shopping Center. Several world-class golf courses are available on the island. Make sure to use the property's glittering pool for some much-needed you-time.

Upon entry, you'll be met with a bright interior and a warm feeling of welcome throughout the space. Relax and make yourself at home by resting on the plush furniture, watching your favorite shows on the large TV, or having brunch on the private balcony. Prepare grand meals and beach picnic snacks in the full kitchen, equipped with stainless steel appliances, a breakfast bar, and a formal dining table. Two bedrooms ensure that everyone will receive a comfortable night's rest from the day's adventures, especially for those who sleep in the bunk beds- perfect for kids to host their own sleepovers!

Beach Skybox - Panoramic and close-up view of the beach and ocean. See, hear and feel the beach and ocean. Our third floor balcony has the best view of the beach and Atlantic Ocean on the island. You can watch the spectacular sunrises and the moon rise over the ocean.  Our condo is renovated and thoroughly cleaned. It has all new appliances and everything replaced. Watch the sunrises and experience the beach and ocean 24/7.The space“Beach Skybox” provides a spectacular panoramic view of the beach and ocean. The sight, sound and feel are simply the best on the island. You can enjoy and experience the mysterious and ever changing moods of the beach and ocean any time of the day and in all seasons.  Everything in the condo is designed around this amazing scenery. We try to provide a comfortable, well-equipped and decorated condo for your vacation and even work if necessary. We are ideal for year round vacations for a couple or a small family.  The queen bed in the bedroom, queen sleeper sofa and bunk beds (76"" x 24"") provide a capacity for 4 adults and 2 children.  But it is more comfortable for 2 to 4 persons.  Beachfront condos are small.  So, please plan accordingly.For your safety, the condo is thoroughly cleaned, sanitized and ozonized before your arrival. Ozone is environmentally friendly, it’s made from oxygen. It kills bacteria and viruses throughout the condo including the ductwork. It decomposes back to oxygen afterwards.  We have an air purifier with plasma wave to kill germs and with HEPA filter to remove dust, pollen, bacteria, viruses and other common air pollutants.  An auto-drain dehumidifier is installed in the bathroom to lower the indoor humidity for your comfort. The heat pump has been serviced and ductwork thoroughly cleaned.  A new EcoBee thermostat helps regulate the  temperature and humidity. Please keep doors closed as much as possible.  If you leave balcony door open, please turn off heat pump.  This is as safe and comfortable as I know how as a chemist.  As a chemist, I understand the danger of chemicals on humans.  I don’t use chemicals lightly.  For example, I don’t use pesticides in and around my house.  Keeping house clean and use traps as necessary work great.For your entertainment, we have new 58” and 32” Samsung UHD TV’s equipped with local HD cable and streaming with YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Videos.

It is paired with TV and can be chosen as desired.  Or you can connect your music to it via bluetooth. Color changing lamps are controlled by a small remote.We provide paper towels, toilet paper, soap, dish washing detergent and dishwasher detergent that usually lasts a week.  We provide most kitchen amenities.  We provide quality towels and linens.It requires a lot of space, work and effort to bring your own beach equipment especially from long distance.

Bring your own favorite beach equipment or use ours.  We are now providing beach towels/blankets. These are oversized (84” x 42”) microfiber towels. They are good for the beach and pool because they are light weight, sand free, soft and quick dry. These can also be used as a blanket for TV watching or as an extra blanket for the bed. They are four in the closet in the hallway. If you use them, just leave them out with other towel, linens for washing when you leave. Please let me know how these towels/blankets work out for you.

Families with four children, or even six adults will enjoy a very comfortable vacation here.Plus, SeaCrest is perhaps the finest oceanfront resort in ultra-desirable Coligny Circle area with two large oceanfront pools and poolside bar/grill.The spaceLocated on the 2nd floor, our 1160 sq ft. SeaCrest condo has undergone a complete renovation that is nothing short of spectacular.  Most notably a kitchen transformation with updated quartz countertops and new refrigerator and oven/stove, the master en-suite bathroom with the addition of a large tiled shower to compliment the large soaking tub plus dual vanities.  And the complete renovation of the second full bathroom with marble flooring and tiled shower.  You will love it!Our villa is an end unit, which offers additional square footage as well as more windows.  A balcony off the living room offers a peek-a-boo ocean view along with tropical landscaped shrubs and palm trees that surround a side parking area.   From the front entrance of the villa, there is a master bedroom on the left decorated in a soothing color scheme. There is a king bed, 42 inch flat screen TV, and a dresser. A closet provides storage for your belongings and extra bedding. The spacious private master bath provides a large soaking tub, large dual-sink vanity and tiled shower.. The second full bath offers a shower and is conveniently located near the living area.Entering the living area guests will note the large dining area and large bunk beds that are cleverly tucked away in a nook area so as to not impede on the living space. Guests will feel inspired to whip up a gourmet meal in the newly updated kitchen. Features include quartz counter tops, and a breakfast bar with 4 tall counter chairs. Serve a special family dinner in the dining area featuring  a wood dining table and six chairs.   It will certainly be easy for a large family of 6 to relax in the tastefully decorated living room.

My husband and I love to travel and meet new people. We are dog people and love our 8 year old mutt, Lucy. The beach is our happy place, but we also love a good hike in the mountains.

Play all of The Sea Pines Resort's three premier courses-each with its own signature character and designation as a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. Tucked away in Lawton Woods (a smaller community inside of Sea Pines), this delightful single-level home is uncomplicated and easy to navigate. A seasonal trolley will whisk you away to all nearby Sea Pines amenities. Rent a bicycle and explore miles of area trails, or make a short drive to nearby beaches.

This beautifully updated three-bedroom home is the ideal family-friendly retreat. Vaulted ceilings, large glass patio doors, and wall-length mirrors add a grand feel to the extra-spacious living area. Kick back on the comfy seating and watch a movie on the 32' flat-screen TV. The well-equipped kitchen has ample counter space and a full suite of appliances to work your culinary magic. When it's time to eat, enjoy festive vacation meals at the dining room table.

This one-level home sleeps up to eight guests between three bedrooms and a queen-size sleeper sofa in the living area. The primary bedroom has a king-size bed and a 32' flat-screen TV. Directly adjacent, the master bathroom has a tub/shower combination. The second bedroom has two twin-size beds and a 32' flat-screen TV. The third bedroom has a queen-size bed and a 32' flat screen TV. These two bedrooms are connected by a Jack-and-Jill bathroom, complete with a tub/shower combination.

The home is far away enough from the neighbors to give a very private feeling to the backyard. Cook your favorite barbeque fare on a gas grill, then dine poolside at the patio with table seating for six. Relax in the private backyard, swim in a large pool (can be heated for a daily fee), or lounge poolside on the spacious patio. 

Go horseback riding at nearby Lawson Stables, just 0.5 miles away. Drive 1.4 miles to the Shops at Sea Pines Center, where you'll find a number of popular dining spots and boutiques. It's 2.2 miles to Harbour Town, home of the Harbour Town Lighthouse, as well as Harbour Town Golf Links. Or head 3.7 miles to Coligny Beach Park and 3.8 miles to South Beach.

Our den has a daybed that sleeps 2 on separate twin beds. Upstairs, you’ll find 3 large bedrooms and 2 full baths, all expertly remodeled. Every single room with a bed in the home has its own smart TV with cable and it is loaded with all the apps you could want. This includes the den, which is great for the little ones to enjoy their own time! The master bedroom has a king size bed with plenty of room to spread out. Traveling with a baby? Remember, that infant doesn’t count in the max guests AND the master closet is tucked away & more than large enough for a private pack & play area (that we provide, as well as a high chair)! The 2nd bedroom has a queen bed as well as a desk/workspace with speedy WiFi throughout the home. The 3rd bedroom has a twin over full bunk bed. There are a few toys in this room as well as a basketball hoop. Find a cabinet downstairs full of board games. We also provide beach towels, boogie boards & beach toys, a backpack cooler, beach bag, and loads of recommendations for a fun week at the beach! Bike rental options are endless on the island & they deliver bikes to/from your front door. We have a large private front porch to store your bikes at night. We take pride in hosting and look forward to chatting soon!

HHI Beach & Tennis is a beachfront resort with complete vacation amenities. Our condo is a first floor condo in Building B, very close to the center of beach activities but far away enough from noise of pool and restaurant. Our condo is just 2-3 minutes from the beach. We provide a clean, safe, comfortable and affordable space for our guests. Our condo is cleaned, sanitized and ozonized. We have a new air system, air purifier and dehumidifier.The spaceWe are steps from two of the four private boardwalks of the resort.  One boardwalk is flat and wide and passes through a large pool and a beach-side restaurant. The other boardwalk has several steps to take to get down to the beach but is less busy.   You can see the top of ocean from the balcony of our condo.  But why strain your neck from any balcony?  Just take 2-3 minutes to go from condo to experience the beach itself.  The beach here is especially wide, flat and clean.  The condo is facing southeast.  In spring and summer, it gets the morning and early afternoon sun but is totally shaded from the blistering summer sun in the afternoon and evening.The queen bed in the bedroom, queen sleeper sofa and bunk beds (76"" x 24"") provide a capacity for 4 adults and 2 children.  But it is more comfortable for 2 to 4 persons.  Beachfront condos are small.  So, please plan accordingly.We try to provide the safest and most comfortable space possible for our guests.  We have installed a new heating and cooling system and have ductwork professionally cleaned.  The condo and linens are carefully cleaned and sanitized for our guests.  In addition, an ozonizer is used to sanitize the condo before each guest arrival.  Ozone is environmentally friendly, it’s made from oxygen.  It kills bacteria and viruses throughout the condo including the ductwork.  It decomposes back to oxygen afterwards.  In addition, we have an air purifier with plasma wave to kill germs and with HEPA filter to remove dust, pollen, bacteria, viruses and other common air pollutants.  We have installed a dehumidifier to inhibit germ growth and for your cooling comfort.  A new EcoBee thermostat helps regulate temperature and humidity.  Please keep doors closed.  This is as safe and comfortable as I know how as a chemist.  As a chemist, I understand the danger of chemicals on humans.  I don’t use chemicals lightly.  For example, I don’t use pesticides in and around my house.  Keeping house clean and use traps as necessary work great.For your entertainment, we have new 58” and 40” Samsung UHD TV’s equipped with local HD cable and streaming with YouTube TV and Amazon Prime Videos.  We provide high speed Internet at 300/30 mbps.  We provide a Wii console with games, a Wii Fit game with balance board to keep you in shape.    It requires a lot of space, work and effort to bring your own beach equipment especially from long distance.
